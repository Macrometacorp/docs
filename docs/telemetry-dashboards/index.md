## Overview:

Telemetry Dashboards are a collection of Grafana-based dashboards for monitoring the performance and health of Macrometa's C8DB service on a GDN instance. The dashboards display real-time metrics based on user-defined Federation, Cluster, Tenant, GeoFabric, and Time Range. 

The C8DB Dashboard provides insights into various aspects of the Macrometa GDN, including region, user, and collection counts, storage sizes, requests per second, and replication rates. 

The Executive Dashboard displays an overall view of the health and operational status of the GDN instance. 

The System Health Dashboard monitors key server metrics such as CPU usage, system load, memory, disk space, and uptime. These dashboards help users understand their database performance and identify potential issues by providing critical insights into various aspects of the Macrometa GDN.
