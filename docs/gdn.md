# Global Data Network (GDN)

Macrometa's Global Data Network (GDN) is a distributed backend network of edge servers offering enterprises the following services for building global applications:

- **[Database](./database/index.md):** Build scalable, distributed backends for performing CRUD operations on data for your business applications.
- **[Compute](./compute/index.md):** This comprise powerful workers at the edge for performing compute-intensive workloads at ultra high performance and low latency.
