# Global Data Network (GDN)

Macrometa's Global Data Network (GDN) is a distributed backend for building global applications. The GDN offers different classes of services:

- Storage: The GDN offers collections as a distributed backend DB, allowing you to store, retrieve, update, and delete data for powering your applications.
- Compute: These comprise powerful workers at the edge for powering processing-intensive workloads at ultra high performance and low latency.
