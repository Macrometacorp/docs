This page explains how to create a query in Macrometa. To learn more about what you can do with queries and the language for writing them, refer to [C8 Query Language](c8ql/../index.md).

## Query Editor

To write a query, log into Macromenta and navigate to the Editor tab of the Query Workers section. Type the content for queries starting with Line 1 of the Query Editor.

## Bind Parameters

[Bind parameters](bind-parameters.md) are created with the '@' symbol and display fields for the corresponding key and value. You can use this to pass values to your query or query worker in the Query Builder.

## Syntax Helper

Macrometa has a built-in tool to help you with C8QL syntax. Click **Syntax** and start typing to see a list of available options.

In the following screenshot, the user typed **min**.

- Save the query as a [query worker](query-workers.md).
