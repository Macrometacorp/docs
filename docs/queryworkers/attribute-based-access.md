title: Attribute-Based Access Control
---

You can save multiple queries as query workers, and then run them concurrently to create an API that uses attributes to limit permissions for users and API keys.

For this example, assume the following organizations each have employees who must access their own data:

- Supplier Store
- Partner 1
- Partner 2

Each partner store needs an API key with appropriate attributes to limit their access. Additionally, individual supplier employees need similar limitations.

For this example, configure an API key for each of the following users, then add an attribute with these values:

| Name           | Attribute    | Value       |
| -------------- | ------------ | ----------- |
| Partner 1      | `partner`    | `partner1`  |
| Partner 2      | `partner`    | `partner2`  |
| Supplier Admin | `employee`   | `admin`     |
| Supplier Staff | `employee`   | `staff`     |

Refer to [Add Attributes to API Keys](../account-management/attributes/add-attributes-api.md) for instructions on adding attributes to API keys.

Create two collections that will contain customer data for the examples: `item` and `customer`.

Run the following query to add data to the `item` collection:

```sql
LET data = [
{ "item": "hammer", "price": 5.99, "count": 55, "partner": "partner1" },
{ "item": "screwdriver", "price": 3.99, "count": 15, "partner": "partner1" },
{ "item": "pliers", "price": 4.95, "count": 28, "partner": "partner2" },
{ "item": "drill", "price": 42.90, "count": 5, "partner": "partner2" }
]

FOR d IN data
    INSERT d INTO item
```

Run the following query to add data to the `customer` collection:

```sql
LET data = [
{ "customer": 1, "item": "hammer", "ordered": 2, "partner": "partner1" },
{ "customer": 2, "item": "drill", "ordered": 1, "partner": "partner2" }
]

FOR d IN data
    INSERT d INTO customer
```

In these examples, Customer 1 is Partner 1 and Customer 2 is Partner 2.

## Example - Attribute Can Only View

This query worker allows partners to see their own items but not update them.

The query worker `PartnerItems` displays data from a collection that partners can access:

```sql
FOR doc IN items
    FILTER doc.partner == CURRENT_APIKEY_ATTRIBUTE("partner")
    RETURN doc
```

When Partner 1 wants to view their data, they can run a command with their API key similar to the following:

```sql
curl -X 'POST' \
  '<https://fulfillment.eng.macrometa.io/_fabric/_system/_api/restql/execute/PartnerItems>' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: apikey <PARTNER 1 API KEY>' \
  -d '{ "bindVars": {}}'
```

Note that in the results, only data with the `partner1` attribute displays:

```sql
{
   { "item": "hammer", "price": 5.99, "count": 55, "partner": "partner1" },
   { "item": "screwdriver", "price": 3.99, "count": 15, "partner": "partner1" }
}
```

## Example - Attribute Can View and Edit

This query worker allows partners to see their own items, but not update them.

The query worker `PartnerOrdersUpdate` updates data in the collection if the active user has access:

```sql
FOR doc IN orders
    FILTER doc.partner == CURRENT_APIKEY_ATTRIBUTE("partner") AND
            doc.customer == @customer
    UPDATE doc WITH {"ordered": doc.ordered + 1} IN orders
    RETURN NEW
```

When Partner 1 wants to update their data, they can run a command with their API key similar to the following:

```
curl -X 'POST' \
    '<https://fulfillment.eng.macrometa.io/_fabric/_system/_api/restql/execute/PartnerOrdersUpdate>' \
    -H 'accept: application/json' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -H 'Authorization: apikey acme_key.897b6e...' \
    -d '{ "bindVars": { "customer": 1}}'
```

The displayed results show the added data:

```sql
{
   { "customer": 1, "item": "hammer", "ordered": 2, "partner": "partner1" }
}
```

On the other hand, if Partner 1 tries to run the same command to edit data belonging to Partner 2:

```
curl -X 'POST' \
    '<https://fulfillment.eng.macrometa.io/_fabric/_system/_api/restql/execute/PartnerOrdersUpdate>' \
    -H 'accept: application/json' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -H 'Authorization: apikey <PARTNER 1 API KEY>' \
    -d '{ "bindVars": { "customer": 2}}'
```

If the user running the command does not have access to the data, the result is empty.

## Example - Limit Access by Attribute

This query worker allows employees to see all items and orders but not update them. Partners can view and update only their own items.

The name of this query worker is `ViewOrders`.

```sql
FOR doc IN orders
    FILTER doc.partner == CURRENT_APIKEY_ATTRIBUTE("partner") OR 
            CURRENT_USER_ATTRIBUTE("employee") == "admin" OR
            CURRENT_USER_ATTRIBUTE("employee") == "staff"
    RETURN doc
```

Partner 1 can run a command to add data to their order:

```
curl -X 'POST' \
    '<https://fulfillment.eng.macrometa.io/_fabric/_system/_api/restql/execute/ViewOrders>' \
    -H 'accept: application/json' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -H 'Authorization: apikey <PARTNER 1 API KEY>' \
    -d '{ "bindVars": {}}'
```

The result shows the added data:

```sql
{
   { "customer": 1, "item": "hammer", "ordered": 2, "partner": "partner1" }
}
```

Similarly, if an employee is logged onto their account they can run a command to view all data:

```
curl -X 'POST' \
    '<https://fulfillment.eng.macrometa.io/_fabric/_system/_api/restql/execute/ViewOrders>' \
    -H 'accept: application/json' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -H 'Authorization: bearer abcdefg...' \
    -d '{ "bindVars": {}}'
```

The result shows data for both customers since the employee has view access to both.

```sql
{
   { "customer": 1, "item": "hammer", "ordered": 2, "partner": "partner1" },
   { "customer": 2, "item": "drill", "ordered": 1, "partner": "partner2" }
}
```


The name of this Query Worker is `OrdersUpdate`.

```sql
FOR doc IN orders
    FILTER doc.customer == @customer AND
            doc.partner == CURRENT_APIKEY_ATTRIBUTE("partner") OR
            CURRENT_USER_ATTRIBUTE("employee") == "admin"
    UPDATE doc WITH {"ordered": doc.ordered + 1} IN orders
    RETURN NEW
```

Partner 1 can run a command to add data to their order:

```
curl -X 'POST' \
    '<https://fulfillment.eng.macrometa.io/_fabric/_system/_api/restql/execute/OrdersUpdate>' \
    -H 'accept: application/json' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -H 'Authorization: apikey <PARTNER 1 API KEY>' \
    -d '{ "bindVars": { "customer": 1}}'
```

Result:

```sql
{
   { "customer": 1, "item": "hammer", "ordered": 3, "partner": "partner1" }
}
```

Similarly, if Partner 1 is logged onto their account they can run a command to add data:

```
curl -X 'POST' \
    '<https://fulfillment.eng.macrometa.io/_fabric/_system/_api/restql/execute/OrdersUpdate>' \
    -H 'accept: application/json' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -H 'Authorization: bearer abcdefg...' \
    -d '{ "bindVars": { "customer": 1}}'
```

Result:

```sql
{
   { "customer": 1, "item": "hammer", "ordered": 4, "partner": "partner1" }
}
```
