title: Data Modification Queries
---

C8QL supports the following data-modification operations:

- **INSERT**: insert new documents into a collection
- **UPDATE**: partially update existing documents in a collection
- **REPLACE**: completely replace existing documents in a collection
- **REMOVE**: remove existing documents from a collection
- **UPSERT**: conditionally insert or update documents in a collection

Below you find some simple example queries that use these operations. The operations are detailed in [C8QL Operations](../c8ql/operations/index.md).

## Transactional Execution
  
On a single server, data-modification operations are executed transactionally. If a data-modification operation fails, any changes made by it will be rolled back automatically as if they never happened.

In a cluster, C8QL data-modification queries are currently not executed transactionally. Additionally, `update`, `replace`, `upsert` and `remove` C8QL queries currently require the `_key` attribute to be specified for all documents that should be modified or removed, even if a shared key attribute other than `_key` was chosen for the collection. This restriction may be overcome in a future release of C8.

## Modifying a single document

Let's start with the basics: `INSERT`, `UPDATE` and `REMOVE` operations on single documents. Here is an example that insert a document in an existing collection _users_:

```js
INSERT {
    firstName: "Anna",
    name: "Pavlova",
    profession: "artist"
} IN users
```

You can provide a key for the new document. If not provided, then Macrometa creates one for you.  

```js
INSERT {
    _key: "GilbertoGil",
    firstName: "Gilberto",
    name: "Gil",
    city: "Fortalezza"
} IN users
```

As Macrometa is schema-free, attributes of the documents may vary:

```js
INSERT {
    _key: "PhilCarpenter",
    firstName: "Phil",
    name: "Carpenter",
    middleName: "G.",
    status: "inactive"
} IN users
```

```js
INSERT {
    _key: "NatachaDeclerck",
    firstName: "Natacha",
    name: "Declerck",
    location: "Antwerp"
} IN users 
```

Update is quite simple. The following C8QL statement will add or change the attributes status and location

```js
UPDATE "PhilCarpenter" WITH {
    status: "active",
    location: "Beijing"
} IN users
```

Replace is an alternative to update where all attributes of the document are replaced.

```js
REPLACE {
    _key: "NatachaDeclerck",
    firstName: "Natacha",
    name: "Leclerc",
    status: "active",
    level: "premium"
} IN users
```

Removing a document if you know its key is simple as well :

```js
REMOVE "GilbertoGil" IN users
```

or

```js
REMOVE { _key: "GilbertoGil" } IN users
```

## Modifying multiple documents

Data-modification operations are normally combined with `FOR` loops to iterate over a given list of documents. They can optionally be combined with `FILTER` statements and the like.

Let's start with an example that modifies existing documents in a collection `users` that match some condition:

```js
FOR u IN users
    FILTER u.status == "not active"
    UPDATE u WITH { status: "inactive" } IN users
```

Now, let's copy the contents of the collection `users` into the collection `backup`:

```js
FOR u IN users
    INSERT u IN backup
```

As a final example, let's find some documents in collection `users` and remove them from collection `backup`. The link between the documents in both collections is established via the documents' keys:

```js
FOR u IN users
    FILTER u.status == "deleted"
    REMOVE u IN backup
```

## Returning documents

Data-modification queries can optionally return documents. In order to reference the inserted, removed or modified documents in a `RETURN` statement, data-modification statements introduce the `OLD` and/or `NEW` pseudo-values:

```js
FOR i IN 1..100
    INSERT { value: i } IN test 
    RETURN NEW
```

```js
FOR u IN users
    FILTER u.status == "deleted"
    REMOVE u IN users 
    RETURN OLD
```

```js
FOR u IN users
    FILTER u.status == "not active"
    UPDATE u WITH { status: "inactive" } IN users 
    RETURN NEW
```

`NEW` refers to the inserted or modified document revision, and `OLD` refers to the document revision before update or removal.

`INSERT` statements can only refer to the `NEW` pseudo-value, and `REMOVE` operations only to `OLD`. `UPDATE`, `REPLACE` and `UPSERT` can refer to either.

In all cases the full documents will be returned with all their attributes, including the potentially auto-generated attributes such as `_id`, `_key`, or `_rev` and the attributes not specified in the update expression of a partial update.

## Restrictions

The name of the modified collection (_users_ and _backup_ in the above cases) must be known to the C8QL executor at query-compile time and cannot change at runtime. Using a bind parameter to specify the collection name is allowed.

Data-modification operations are restricted to one collection at a time. It is not possible to use multiple data-modification operations for the same collection in the same query, or follow up a data-modification operation for a specific collection with a read operation for the same collection. Neither is it possible to follow up any data-modification operation with a traversal query (which may read from arbitrary collections not necessarily known at the start of the traversal).

That means you may not place several `REMOVE` or `UPDATE` statements for the same collection into the same query. It is however possible to modify different collections by using multiple data-modification operations for different collections in the same query.

In case you have a query with several places that need to remove documents from the same collection, it is recommended to collect these documents or their keys in an array and have the documents from that array removed using a single `REMOVE` operation.

Data-modification operations can optionally be followed by `LET` operations to perform further calculations and a `RETURN` operation to return data.
