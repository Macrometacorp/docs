Each collection in Macrometa GDN can be a stream. Collection streams use the WebSocket protocol to emit event messages for operations performed on the collection.

The Stream tab is only displayed if streams are enabled on that collection.

For more information about streams, refer to [Streams](../streams/index.md) and [Stream Workers](../cep/index.md).
