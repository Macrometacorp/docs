The Key-Value Store Data tab is the primary section for viewing individual collection information.

![Key-Value Store Data Tab](/img/collections/kv-store-data.png)

This is a complex tab which contains the following items.

## Collection Name

The name of the collection that you are viewing is displayed above the tab, in the upper left corner of the screen.

## Create New Pair

Create a new key-value pair inside the selected collection and add data. For more information, refer to [Add Key-Value Pairs](add-key-value-pairs.md).

## Delete Pair

Click the red minus next to a key-value pair to remove it from the collection.

## Key

The key that corresponds to the document. Every key has a unique value.

## Value

Displays the value corresponding to the key.

## Expire At

The exact time when the time-to-live (TTL) index expires (date and time). Expiration is not required, so the value might be N/A.

## Edit a Pair

Click a key-value record to open the Edit Pair window. You can change the **Value** and **Expire At** fields, but not the **_key**.
