title: Redis Mode Collection
---

The data store that Macrometa provides is compatible with most Redis API use cases.

:::note
Redis support is a beta feature.
:::

You must create a Redis Mode collection before you can use Redis with Macrometa. You can read and write to Redis collections using the following methods:

- [Macrometa API](../../api-docs/index)
- [C8QL](../../queryworkers/c8ql/index)
- [SDKs](../../queryworkers/redis/redis-sdks)

For more information about using Redis in Macrometa, refer to [Redis](../../queryworkers/redis/index).
