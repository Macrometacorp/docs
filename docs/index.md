Macrometa's Global Data Network (GDN) is a distributed backend for building global applications. If you're still curious as to why you should build on Macrometa rather than on the centralized cloud (AWS, GCP, or Azure), please keep reading. Otherwise, you may skip this section and get started on our address book demo.

1. **Low-latency for Everyone**: Wouldn't it be nice if you could provide a consistent end-user experience for your customers, regardless of where they are located? With Macrometa, your data is no longer centralized in a specific region like us-east-1, but rather replicated and available for reads and writes (N-Active) from 175+ locations around the world, allowing you to build stateful applications as close to your end-users as possible. The added benefit of global replication with CRDTs ensures business continuity if a particular region or multiple regions were to fail. For the developers out there, you won't even need to change your endpoint as it will automatically reconnect you to the closest region!

2. **Faster Time-To-Market**: Macrometa is a converged technology Platform as a Service (PaaS) consisting of a multi-model database (K/V, document, search, graph), stream engine, complex event processing, and compute capabilities. Utilizing a single platform as opposed to stitching together a variety of services _a la carte_ in the public cloud allows you to build, iterate, and execute faster.

3. **Lower Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)**: Building on the previous example, multiple cloud services are needed to build applications. When it's time to scale out to support a global audience, you'll end up utilizing several databases, maintaining copies of your data within multiple regions, and the costs will add up very quickly. Within the Macrometa GDN is a true [multi-model database](https://www.macrometa.com/topics/multi-model-database), allowing you to query one copy of data with extremely low latency anywhere in the world. Your development team will be free to spend more time on the business logic and less time focusing on the data layer and movement.
