## Query Parameters

|----------|---------------------------------------|-------------|-----------------|----------|---------|
| length | The number of events that should be included in a sliding length window. |          | INT        | No       | No      |

## Example

```sql
CREATE STREAM cseEventStream (symbol string, price float, volume int);
CREATE WINDOW StockEventWindow (symbol string, price float, volume int) SLIDING_LENGTH(10) output all events;
CREATE SINK STREAM OutputStream (symbol string, price double);

@info(name = 'query0')
INSERT INTO StockEventWindow
FROM cseEventStream;

@info(name = 'query1')
INSERT all events INTO OutputStream 
SELECT symbol, sum(price) AS price
FROM StockEventWindow;
```

This query processes the last 10 events in a sliding manner.
