## Example 1


    @PrimaryKey("symbol")
    @Index("volume:1", {background:true,unique:true}")
    CREATE STORE FooTable WITH (type="mongodb",mongodb.uri="mongodb://admin:admin@localhost/Foo") (symbol string, price float, volume long);

This will create a collection called FooTable for the events to be saved
with symbol as Primary Key(unique index at mongoDB level) and index for
the field volume will be created in ascending order with the index
option to create the index in the background. Note: @PrimaryKey: This
specifies a list of comma-separated values to be treated as unique
fields in the table. Each record in the table must have a unique
combination of values for the fields specified here. @Index: This
specifies the fields that must be indexed at the database level. You can
specify multiple values as a come-separated list. A single value to be
in the format, `<FieldName>:<SortOrder>`. The last element is optional
through which a valid index options can be passed.         


`<SortOrder>`: 1 for Ascending & -1 for Descending. Optional, with default value as 1. 
`<IndexOptions>`: Index Options must be defined inside curly brackets.             

Options must follow the standard mongodb index options format.
            https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/db.collection.createIndex/
Example 1: @Index(`'symbol:1'`, `'{"unique":true}'`)
Example 2: @Index(`'symbol'`, `'{"unique":true}'`)
Example 3: @Index(`'symbol:1'`, `'volume:-1'`, `'{"unique":true}'`)
