title: Script
---

Scripts allow you to write functions in other programming languages and execute them within queries for a stream. Functions defined via scripts can be accessed in queries similar to any other inbuilt function. **Function definitions** can be used to define these scripts.

Function parameters are passed into the function logic as `Object[]` and with the name `data` .

**Purpose**

Scripts allow you to define a function operation that is not provided in Stream core or its extension. It is not required to write an extension to define the function logic.

**Syntax**

The syntax for a Script definition is as follows.

```
define function <function name>[<language name>] return <return type> {
    <operation of the function>
};
```

The following parameters are configured when defining a script.

| Parameter     | Description |
| ------------- |-------------|
| `function name`| 	The name of the function (`camelCase` is used for the function name) as a convention.|
|`language name`| The name of the programming language used to define the script, such as `javascript`, `r` and `scala`.|
| `return type`| The attribute type of the functionâ€™s return. This can be `int`, `long`, `float`, `double`, `string`, `bool` or `object`. Here the function implementer should be responsible for returning the output attribute on the defined return type for proper functionality.
|`operation of the function`| Here, the execution logic of the function is added. This logic should be written in the language specified under the `language name`, and it should return the output in the data type specified via the `return type` parameter.

**Examples**

This query performs concatenation using JavaScript, and returns the output as a string.

```
CREATE function concatFn[javascript] return string {
    var str1 = data[0];
    var str2 = data[1];
    var str3 = data[2];
    var response = str1 + str2 + str3;
    return response;
};

CREATE STREAM TempStream(deviceID long, roomNo int, temp double);
CREATE STREAM DeviceTempStream (id string, temp double);

insert into DeviceTempStream
select concatFn(roomNo,'-',deviceID) as id, temp
from TempStream;
```
