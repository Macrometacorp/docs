title: lookingAt (Function)
---

Matches the input.sequence from the beginning against the regex pattern, and unlike `regex:matches() it does not require that the entire input.sequence be matched.`

## Syntax

    <BOOL> regex:lookingAt(<STRING> regex, <STRING> input.sequence)

## Query Parameters

| Name           | Description          | Default Value | Possible Data Types | Optional | Dynamic |
