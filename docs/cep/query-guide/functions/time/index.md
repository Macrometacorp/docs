The time functions available to stream workers include `date`, `dateDiff`, `extract`, `utcTimestamp`, `dayofWeek`, `currentDate`, `currentTime`, and many others. These functions enable operations such as extracting specific date components, calculating the difference between dates, converting timestamps to universal time, and obtaining the current date and time.

This section, focuses on the time functions offered for stream workers, demonstrating their usage and highlighting their capabilities in handling temporal data within streaming data pipelines.
