|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------------|----------|---------|

## Example

    CREATE WINDOW cseEventWindow (symbol string, price float, volume int) externalTime(eventTime, 20 sec) output expired events;

    @info(name = 'query0')
    insert into cseEventWindow
    from cseEventStream;

    @info(name = 'query1')
    insert expired events into outputStream
    select symbol, sum(price) as price
