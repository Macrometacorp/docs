title: delay (Window)
---

A delay window holds events for a specific time period that is regarded as a delay period before processing them.

## Syntax

    delay(<INT|LONG|TIME> window.delay)

## Query Parameters

| Name         | Description                                                                               | Default Value | Possible Data Types | Optional | Dynamic |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------------|----------|---------|
| window.delay | The time period (specified in sec, min, ms) for which the window should delay the events. |               | INT LONG TIME       | No       | No      |

## Example

    CREATE WINDOW delayWindow(symbol string, volume int) delay(1 hour);
    CREATE STREAM PurchaseStream(symbol string, volume int);
    CREATE STREAM DeliveryStream(symbol string);
    CREATE STREAM OutputStream(symbol string);

    @info(name='query1')
    insert into delayWindow
    select symbol, volume
    from PurchaseStream;

    @info(name='query2')
    insert into OutputStream
    select delayWindow.symbol
    from delayWindow join DeliveryStream
    on delayWindow.symbol == DeliveryStream.symbol;

In this example, purchase events that arrive in the `PurchaseStream` stream are directed to a delay window. At any given time, this delay window holds purchase events that have arrived within the last hour.

These purchase events in the window are matched by the `symbol` attribute, with delivery events that arrive in the `DeliveryStream` stream. This monitors whether the delivery of products is done with a minimum delay of one hour after the purchase.
