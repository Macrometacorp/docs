This section lists all the stream worker functions provided by Macrometa GDN and explains how they work.


Functions enhance Macrometa Stream QL, the language used to write stream workers, by seamlessly incorporating additional capabilities.
Macrometa Stream QL provides various in-built functions to access and manage event data according to our requirements. Functions can accept 
zero or more parameters, perform actions and return the result. 

Functions allow you to :

- Use different data sources.
- Use different sinks, such as GDN Streams, Kafka, and ActiveMQ.
- Appropriate format mapping, such as JSON, XML, or CSV.
- Different kinds of processing, such as math, string, statistics, and geospatial.
- Data aggregation.
- Write logical expressions.

## IO Function Types

|Key-Value|This function converts events having Key-Value maps to/from stream proceesor events.|
|Text|This function that converts text messages to/from stream processor events.|


## Example

This stream application with the name `TestFunctions` creates a stream named `FooStream`. This configuration for `SOURCE FooStream` performs input mapping using
**JSON Format Mappers function**. For a single event, the input is required to be in following format:


    {    
        "event":{        
            "symbol":"GDN",        
            "price":"55.6",        
            "volume":"100"    
        }
    }


On receiving the event, a query is executed which parses string data types using **Execution function (math)** into required formats.
After which the data gets inserted into Kafka `SINK` using **Apache Kafka IO function**.


```js
@App:name('TestFunctions') 

CREATE SOURCE FooStream WITH (type='inMemory', topic='stock', map.type='json') (symbol string, price string, volume string);

@info(name = 'query1') 

CREATE SINK BarStream WITH (type='kafka', topic='topic_with_partitions', partition.no='0', bootstrap.servers='localhost:9092', map.type='json') (symbol string, price double, volume long);

insert into BarStream
select symbol, math:parseDouble(price), math:parseLong(volume) 
from FooStream;
```
