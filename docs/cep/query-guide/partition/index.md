Partitions divide streams and queries into isolated groups in order to process them in parallel and in isolation. A partition can contain one or more queries and there can be multiple instances where the same queries and streams are replicated for each partition.

Each partition is tagged with a partition key. Those partitions only process the events that match the corresponding partition key.

## Purpose

Partitions allow you to process the events groups in isolation so that event processing can be performed using the same set of queries for each group.

## Generate Partition Key

A partition key can be generated by value or by range.

### Partition by Value

This is created by generating unique values using input stream attributes.

#### Syntax

```sql
partition with ( <expression> of <stream name>,
                    <expression> of <stream name>, ... )
begin
    <query>
    <query>
    ...
end;
```

#### Example

This query calculates the maximum temperature recorded within the last 10 events per `deviceID`.

```sql
partition with (deviceID of TempStream)
begin
    insert into DeviceTempStream
    select roomNo, deviceID, max(temp) as maxTemp
    from TempStream window sliding_length (10);
end;
```

### Partition by Range

This is created by mapping each partition key to a range condition of the input streams numerical attribute.

#### Syntax

```sql
partition with ( <condition> as <partition key> or
                    <condition> as <partition key> or ... of <stream name>,
                    ... )
begin
    <query>
    <query>
    ...
end;
```

#### Example

This query calculates the average temperature for the last 10 minutes per office area.

```sql
partition with ( roomNo >= 1030 as 'serverRoom' or
    roomNo < 1030 and roomNo >= 330 as 'officeRoom' or
    roomNo < 330 as 'lobby' of TempStream)
begin
    insert into AreaTempStream
    select roomNo, deviceID, avg(temp) as avgTemp
    from TempStream window sliding_time(10 min)
end;
```
