title: prometheus
---

This source consumes Prometheus metrics that are exported from a specified URL as stream worker events by sending HTTP requests to the URL.
Based on the source configuration, it analyzes metrics from the text response and sends them as Stream App events through key-value mapping. The user can retrieve metrics of the `including`, `counter`, `gauge`, `histogram`, and `summary` types. The source retrieves the metrics from a text response of the target. Therefore, it is you need to use `string` as the attribute type for the attributes that correspond with the Prometheus metric labels. Further, the Prometheus metric value is passed through the event as `value`. This requires you to include an attribute named `value` in the stream definition. The supported types for the `value` attribute are `INT`, `LONG`, `FLOAT`, and `DOUBLE`.

## Example 1

```sql
CREATE SOURCE FooStream1 WITH (type= 'prometheus', target.url= 'http://localhost:9080/metrics', metric.type= 'counter', metric.name= 'sweet_production_counter', map.type='keyvalue') (metric_name string, metric_type string, help string, subtype string, name string, quantity string, value double);
```

In this example, the Prometheus source sends an HTTP request to the `target.url` and analyzes the response. From the analyzed response, the source retrieves the Prometheus counter metrics with the `sweet_production_counter` name and converts the filtered metrics into stream worker events using the key-value mapper. The generated maps have keys and values as follows:

```
metric_name -> sweet_production_counter   
metric_type -> counter   
help -> help_string_of_metric   
subtype -> null   
name -> value_of_label_name   
quantity -> value_of_label_quantity
value -> value_of_metric
```

## Example 2

```sql
CREATE SOURCE FooStream2 WITH (type='prometheus', target.url= 'http://localhost:9080/metrics', metric.type='summary', metric.name='sweet_production_summary', map.type='keyvalue') (metric_name string, metric_type string, help string, subtype string, name string, quantity string, quantile string, value double);
```

In this example, the Prometheus source sends an HTTP request to the `target.url` and analyzes the response. From the analyzed response, the source retrieves the Prometheus summary metrics with the `sweet_production_summary` name and converts the filtered metrics into stream worker events using the key-value mapper. The generated maps have keys and values as follows:

```
metric_name -> sweet_production_summary   
metric_type -> summary   
help -> help_string_of_metric   
subtype -> `sum`/`count`/`null`   
name -> value_of_label_name
quantity -> value_of_label_quantity   
quantile -> value of the quantile   
value -> value_of_metric
```

## Example 3

```sql
CREATE SOURCE FooStream3 WITH (type= 'prometheus', target.url= 'http://localhost:9080/metrics', metric.type= 'histogram', metric.name= 'sweet_production_histogram', map.type='keyvalue') (metric_name string, metric_type string, help string, subtype string, name string, quantity string, le string, value double);
```

In this example, the prometheus source sends an HTTP request to the `target.url` and analyzes the response. From the analyzed response, the source retrieves the Prometheus histogram metrics with the `sweet_production_histogram` name and converts the filtered metrics into stream worker events using the key-value mapper. The generated maps have keys and values as follows:

```
metric_name -> sweet_production_histogram   
metric_type -> histogram   
help -> <help_string_of_metric>   
subtype -> <`sum`/`count`/`bucket`>   
name -> <value_of_label_name>
quantity -> <value_of_label_quantity>   
le -> <value of the bucket>   
value -> <value_of_metric>
