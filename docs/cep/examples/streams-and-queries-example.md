title: Streams and Queries Example
---

This page provides an example of `streams` and `queries`, and how multiple queries can be chained to one another.

There are multiple type of queries such as `window query`, `join query`, `pattern query`, etc. Below example explains how `pass-through` and `selection queries` work. For more info refer the [Stream Query Guide](../query-guide/index.md).

## Example

The following is an example annotated with descriptive comments.

```sql
-- Defines `InputTemperatureStream` stream to pass events having `sensorId` and `temperature` attributes of types `string` and `double`.
CREATE STREAM InputTemperatureStream (sensorId string, temperature double);

-- Optional `@info` annotation to name the query.
@info(name = 'Pass-through')

-- Query to consume events from `InputTemperatureStream`, produce new events by selecting all the attributes from the incoming events, and outputs them to `TemperatureStream`.
INSERT INTO TemperatureAndSensorStream
SELECT *
FROM InputTemperatureStream;

@info(name = 'Simple-selection')

-- Selects only the `temperature` attribute from events, and outputs to `TemperatureOnlyStream`.
-- Consumes events from `TemperatureAndSensorStream`. The schema of the stream is inferred from the previous query, hence no need to be defined.
INSERT INTO TemperatureOnlyStream
SELECT temperature
FROM TemperatureAndSensorStream;
```

## Events at Each Stream

When an event with values [`'aq-14'`, `35.4`] is sent to `InputTemperatureStream` stream, it is converted and travels through the streams as below.

- InputTemperatureStream : [`'aq-14'`, `35.4`]
- TemperatureAndSensorStream : ['aq-14', `35.4`]
- TemperatureOnlyStream : [`35.4`]
