Any stream worker can be used as an API endpoint.

## Create an API Endpoint

You can create a REST API endpoint from a stream worker.

1. [Log in to your Macrometa account](https://auth.paas.macrometa.io/).
1. Click **Compute > Stream Workers**.
1. Write and save stream worker as described in [Create a Stream Worker](create-stream-worker.md).
1. Click **API Endpoint**.

Macrometa displays the cURL (Client URL) command that you can use in the terminal or command line to make an API call and run the query.

## Stream Worker Endpoints

Why would a user want to do this? Can they send info to a stream worker? Receive it from? What is the point of this cURL commend?
