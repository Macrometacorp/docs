When using the Chrome Here are some recommendations to ensure optimum performance when using your Virtual desktops:

## Hardware acceleration settings

Adjust your hardware acceleration settings to boost Chrome performance and achieve faster page loading times. Hardware acceleration reduces CPU workload by offloading CPU-intensive tasks to idle hardware components like the GPU (graphic designer).

To do this:
1. Type **chrome://settings/system** in the Chrome address bar
1. Disable **"Use graphics acceleration when available"**

## Configure tab management

Chrome offers numerous performance controls to proactively detect and fix issues. One of these controls is the memory saver, which frees up resources for active tabs. To do this:

1. Type **chrome://settings/performance** in the Chrome address bar
2. Enable **"Memory Saver,"** which suspends inactive tabs. This memory saver offers three savings levels, with the maximum level labeling tabs inactive after a shorter period.

## Disable background processes

Processes running in the background can slow processing speed and negatively impact the performance of your VDI browser. To disable this:

1. Type **chrome://settings/system** in the address bar
1. Disable **"Continue running background apps when Google Chrome is closed"**
