This dashboard provides a unified and easy-to-understand overview into the desktops provisioned across your Workspace subscriptions using key metrics such as:

- **Total desktops**
- **Active desktops**
- **Users assigned**
- **Users unassigned**
- **Total users**

## Applying filters

The dashboards provides filters like regions, desktops plans, and client types that allows its users to sort through and narrow results to access more granular insights.

For example, this filters for Native client users in the Mumbai region from the start of the month till the 14th.
