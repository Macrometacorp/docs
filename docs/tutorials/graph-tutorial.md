This example shows the ability of graph databases in analyzing and offering recommendations for items that are commonly purchased together. By establishing connections between customer and item vertices using edge collections, the graph is able to accurately deliver tailored recommendations to customers who have bought a particular item.

In the graph that we created ,customers Dino and Durga bought the same items. The graph is able to recommend items to Dallas based on the items that Dino and Durga bought. This is a simple example of how graph databases can be used to offer recommendations to customers.

## Define Vertices and Edges

For this example we will have two vertex collections - `groceryCustomers` and `groceryItems` and one edge collection - `groceryOrders`. The `groceryOrders` edge collection will be used to establish a connection between a customer and an item that they bought. Vertex collections are document store collections that store the vertices of a graph. Edge collections are graph edge collections that store the edges of a graph, edge collections have the `_from` and `_to` attributes that are used to establish a connection between two vertices.

Vertex example in `groceryCustomers` collection:

```json
{
    "_key": "C01",
    "name": "John Doe"
},
...
```

Vertex example in `groceryItems` collection:

```json
{
    "_key": "P03",
    "name": "pineapple"
},
...
```

Graph edge example in `groceryOrders` collection (Connection between customer C01 and item P03):

```json
{
    "_from": "groceryCustomers/C01",
    "_key": "4117657795",
    "_to": "groceryItems/P03"
},
...
```

## Import the Example Data

If you want to try out the example, you can import the data into your Macrometa GDN account.
Data can be found in the `sample-data` folder of this [repository](https://github.com/Macrometacorp/macrometa-graph-example).

- Create two [document collections](../collections/documents/index.md) in Macrometa GDN.
    - `groceryItems`
    - `groceryCustomers`

- Create one [edge collection](../collections/graph-edge/index.md) in Macrometa GDN.
    - `groceryOrders`

- Import test data from sample-data folder to created collections using console. Name of the files are the same as the collection names.

## How to Create the Graph on Macrometa GDN

Now that we have the data imported, we can create the graph on Macrometa GDN using javascript SDK.

### Prerequisites

- A free trial [Macrometa account](https://auth-play.macrometa.io/).
- A Node.js 14+ installation on your local machine. You can download it from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
- Install the Macrometa [javascript SDK](../sdks/install-sdks.md).

:::note
To check your Node.js version, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
node -v
```
:::

### Create a Graph

<Tabs groupId="operating-systems">
<TabItem value="js" label="Javascript">

```js
const jsc8 = require("jsc8");

client = new jsc8({
  url: "https://play.paas.macrometa.io",
  apiKey: "xxxxx",
  fabricName: "_system",
});

// Edge collections and vertices must be created before running this script.
async function createGraph() {
  const response = await client.createGraph("grocery-graph", {
    edgeDefinitions: [
      {
        // Edge collection name --> This collection holds relationships between vertices
        collection: "groceryOrders",
        // Vertex collection that is used as the start vertex of the edge
        from: ["groceryCustomers"],
        // Vertex collection that is used as the start vertex of the edge
        to: ["groceryItems"],
      },
    ],
  });
  console.log(response);
}
createGraph();
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

After we have created the graph, we can start querying it.

## How to Query the Graph

### Query Explanation

Query for the recommendations for a customer can be done using the following query:

<Tabs groupId="operating-systems">
<TabItem value="js" label="C8QL">


```js

// Query: Recommend the most popular item in the grocery store based on the number of users who purchased it
LET doc = (FOR d in groceryItems FILTER d.name == @name RETURN d)[0]
FOR user IN 1..1 INBOUND doc groceryOrders
    FOR item IN 1..1 OUTBOUND user groceryOrders
        COLLECT i=item.name WITH COUNT INTO c
        FILTER i != @name
        SORT c DESC
        // LIMIT 2
        RETURN {"item": i, "count": c}   // item -> number of users who purchased it
                                         // count -> number of times it was purchased
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

The `@name` is a bind variable that can be set to any item name. In this example we can set it to `peanut butter`. First we are filtering by item name and then collecting all the users who purchased that item. Then we are collecting all the items that were purchased by those users. We are filtering out the item that we are looking (`peanut butter`) for and sorting the result by the number of times it was purchased.

### Create Query Worker

It is possible to create a Query Worker on Macrometa GDN using console, javascript SDK, CLI or using the REST API.
You can create [Query Worker](../queryworkers/index.md) by yourself or you can use the one that is already created for this example.
Exported Query Worker can be found in the `sample-data` folder of this [repository](https://github.com/Macrometacorp/macrometa-graph-example). It is possible to import the query worker using console. (`import-query.json`)

After we have created the Query Worker, we can start using it using the following code:

<Tabs groupId="operating-systems">
<TabItem value="js" label="Javascript">

```js
const jsc8 = require("jsc8");

client = new jsc8({
  url: "https://play.paas.macrometa.io",
  apiKey: "xxxxx",
  fabricName: "_system",
});

let itemCustomerSelected = "peanut butter";

async function queryGraph() {
  // Query has bind variables that we need to provide as a second argument
  response = await client.executeRestql("grocery-recomendations", {
    name: itemCustomerSelected,
  });
  console.log(response.result);
}
queryGraph();
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

### Query Result

When you call Query Worker with `peanut butter` item as bind variable, the result will be following recommendation:

```json
[
  { item: 'jelly', count: 2 },
  { item: 'napkins', count: 2 },
  { item: 'strawberry', count: 2 },
  { item: 'banana', count: 1 },
  { item: 'milk', count: 1 },
  { item: 'celery', count: 1 },
  { item: 'bread', count: 1 },
  { item: 'white claw', count: 1 },
  { item: 'kiwi', count: 1 },
  { item: 'ketchup', count: 1 },
  { item: 'apple', count: 1 }
]
```

First recommendation according to this query is jelly which is purchased by two users. Second recommendation is napkins which is purchased by two users. Third recommendation is strawberry which is purchased by two users.

## CRUD Operations on Graph

We've demonstrated how to create a graph and perform queries using the Query Worker. With the JavaScript SDK, you can also easily create, read, update, and delete vertices and edges within the graph, allowing for efficient management and interaction with your graph data.

A comprehensive example illustrating CRUD operations on graphs can be found in the [repository](https://github.com/Macrometacorp/macrometa-graph-example). Explore the repository to learn more about implementing these operations and harnessing the full power of the Macrometa platform.
