The Samples tab contains a number of sample stream workers that you can load and run. This is a low-friction way to see and experiment with stream worker functionality.

## Access Samples

To access the Samples tab:

1. [Log in to your Macrometa account](https://auth.paas.macrometa.io/).
2. Click **Data > Stream Workers**.
3. Click **Samples**.

   Macrometa displays the Samples tab, which contain the samples in alphabetical order. Each sample stream worker has a brief description to help you understand its purpose. Many samples also have description text visible in the code to help you run and test the sample.
