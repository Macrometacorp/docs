title: Sink Mapping
---

Each `sink.type` configuration can have a mapping denoted by the `map.type` annotation that defines how to convert stream events to outgoing messages with the defined format.

The `type` parameter of the `map.type` defines the map type to be used in converting the outgoing events. The other parameters of `map.type` annotation depends on the mapper selected, and some of its parameters can be optional and/or dynamic.

For detailed information about the parameters see the documentation of the relevant mapper.

## Map Payload

`map.payload` is an optional annotation used with `map.type` to define custom mapping. When the `map.payload` annotation is not provided, each mapper maps the outgoing events to its own default event format. The `map.payload` annotation allow users to configure mappers to produce the output payload of their choice, and by using dynamic properties within the payload they can selectively extract and add data from the published Stream events.

There are two ways you to configure `map.payload` annotation.

1. Some mappers such as `JSON` and `Test` only accept one output payload:

  ```js
  map.payload='This is a test message from {{user}}.'
  ```

2. Some mappers such `key-value` accept series of mapping values:

  ```js
  map.payload= key1='mapping_1', 'key2'='user : {{user}}'
  ```

  Here, the keys of payload mapping can be defined using the dot notation as ```a.b.c```, or using any constant string value as `'$abc'`.

## Supported Sink Mapping Types

The following is a list of sink mapping types supported by stream workers:

|Sink Mapping Type | Description|
| ------------- |-------------|
| [CSV](csv.md) | Converts CSV-like delimiter separated events to stream events.|
| [JSON](json.md) | Converts JSON messages to stream events.|
| [Key-Value](keyvalue.md) | Converts key-value hash maps to stream events.|
| [PassThrough](passThrough.md) | Omits data conversion on stream events.|
| [Text](text.md) | Converts plain text messages to stream events.|

:::tip
When the `map.type` annotation is not provided, `map.type='passThrough'` is used as default, that passes the outgoing events directly to the sinks without any data conversion.

## Example 1

Publishes `OutputStream` events by converting them to `JSON` messages with the default format, and by sending to an `HTTP` endpoint `http://localhost:8005/endpoint1`, using `POST` method, `Accept` header, and basic authentication having `admin` is both username and password.

The configuration of the `HTTP` sink and `JSON` sink mapper to achieve the above is as follows.

```sql
CREATE SINK OutputStream WITH (sink.type='http', publisher.url='http://localhost:8005/endpoint', method='POST', headers='Accept-Date:20/02/2017', basic.auth.enabled='true', basic.auth.username='admin', basic.auth.password='admin', map.type='json') (name string, age int, country string);
```

This publishes a `JSON` message on the following format:

```json
{
  "event":{
    "name":"Paul",
    "age":20,
    "country":"UK"
  }
}
```

## Example 2

Publishes `StockStream` events by converting them to user defined `JSON` messages, and by sending to an `HTTP` endpoint `http://localhost:8005/stocks`.

The configuration of the `HTTP` sink and custom `JSON` sink mapping to achieve the above is as follows.

```sql
CREATE SINK StockStream WITH (sink.type='http', publisher.url='http://localhost:8005/stocks', map.type='json', validate.json='true', enclosing.element='$.Portfolio', map.payload="""{"StockData":{ "Symbol":"{{symbol}}", "Price":{{price}} }}""") (symbol string, price float, volume long);
```

This publishes a single event as the `JSON` message on the following format:

```json
{
  "Portfolio":{
    "StockData":{
      "Symbol":"GOOG",
      "Price":55.6
    }
  }
}
```

This can also publish multiple events together as a `JSON` message on the following format:

```json
{
  "Portfolio":[
    {
      "StockData":{
        "Symbol":"GOOG",
        "Price":55.6
      }
    },
    {
      "StockData":{
        "Symbol":"FB",
        "Price":57.0
      }
    }
  ]  
}
```

## Example 3

Publishes events from the `OutputStream` stream to multiple `HTTP` endpoints using a partitioning strategy. Here the events are sent to either `http://localhost:8005/endpoint1` or `http://localhost:8006/endpoint2` based on the partitioning key `country`. It uses default `JSON` mapping, `POST` method, and used `admin` as both the username and the password when publishing to both the endpoints.

The configuration of the distributed `HTTP` sink and `JSON` sink mapper to achieve the above is:

```sql
CREATE SINK OutputStream WITH (sink.type='http', method='POST', basic.auth.enabled='true', basic.auth.username='admin', basic.auth.password='admin', map.type='json', distribution.strategy='partitioned', partitionKey='country', destination.publisher.url='http://localhost:8005/endpoint1', destination.publisher.url='http://localhost:8006/endpoint2') (name string, age int, country string);
```

This partitions the outgoing events and publish all events with the same country attribute value to the same endpoint. The `JSON` message published will be in the following format:

```json
{
  "event":{
    "name":"Paul",
    "age":20,
    "country":"UK"
  }
}
```
