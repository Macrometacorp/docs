Sentiment analysis is a crucial aspect of processing and understanding unstructured text data, such as social media posts, customer reviews, or any form of text communication. By determining the underlying sentiment of a piece of text, businesses and organizations can gain valuable insights into the opinions and emotions of their users or customers.

With the built-in sentiment functionality, you can quickly evaluate and assign sentiment scores to incoming text messages, allowing for immediate analysis and decision-making based on the sentiment of the data.
