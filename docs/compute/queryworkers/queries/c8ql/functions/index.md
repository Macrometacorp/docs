C8QL supports functions to allow more complex computations. Functions can be called at any query position where an expression is allowed. The general function call syntax is:

```js
FUNCTIONNAME(arguments)
```

where `FUNCTIONNAME` is the name of the function to be called, and `arguments` is a comma-separated list of function arguments. If a function does not need any arguments, the argument list can be left empty. However, even if the argument list is empty the parentheses around it are still mandatory to make function calls distinguishable from variable names.

Some example function calls:

```js
HAS(user, "name")
LENGTH(friends)
COLLECTIONS()
```

In contrast to collection and variable names, function names are case-insensitive, i.e. `LENGTH(foo)` and `length(foo)` are equivalent.
