* [FILTER](filter.md): Restrict the results to elements that match arbitrary logical conditions.
* [SORT](sort.md): Force a sort of the array of already produced intermediate results.
* [LIMIT](limit.md): Reduce the number of elements in the result to at most the specified number, optionally skip elements (pagination).
* [LET](let.md): Assign an arbitrary value to a variable.
* [COLLECT](collect.md): Group an array by one or multiple group criteria. Can also count and aggregate.
* [REMOVE](remove.md): Remove documents from a collection.
* [UPDATE](update.md): Partially update documents in a collection.
* [REPLACE](replace.md): Completely replace documents in a collection.
* [INSERT](insert.md): Insert new documents into a collection.
