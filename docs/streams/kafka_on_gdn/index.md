title: Kafka on GDN - Beta
---

Kafka on GDN brings the native Apache Kafka protocol support to GDN Streams by introducing a Kafka protocol handler on GDN Streams brokers. By adding the Kafka on GDN protocol handler to your existing GDN Streams cluster, you can migrate your existing Kafka applications and services to GDN Streams without modifying the code. This enables Kafka applications to leverage Macrometa Streams.

This feature is in beta. Please contact support if you have any problems.
