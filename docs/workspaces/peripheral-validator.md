# Peripherals Validator

The Peripheral Validator is a utility designed to ensure your devices are properly configured and ready for use within your Cloud Workspace environment. This feature enables users to utilize hardware typically constrained to local environments within their remote sessions.

Cloud workspaces currently support the following peripheral devices:

- Signature pads
- Card readers
- Webcams
- Printers

# Prerequisites

Before using the Peripheral Validator, ensure you have completed the following steps:

1. Navigate to **Workspace Settings** and select **Drivers and updates** to download the installer file.

2. Run the installer on your local machine. This process installs all necessary drivers and configurations required for peripheral support.

Once the drivers are installed, use the Peripheral Validator to check the functionality of your connected devices. This tool verifies that your peripherals are correctly set up and operational within the remote environment.

# Using the Peripheral Validator

Navigate to **Workspace Settings** and select **Peripherals Validator** to start the validation process for each device.
