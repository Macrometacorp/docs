The Workspaces homepage displays the different tools available in the service, and allows you to navigate between these tools. With the appropriate installer installed and depending on your business needs, you can now connect to [RBA](./remote-browser-accelerator/index.md) or [VDI](./remote-desktop-enviroment/index.md). 

Workspaces also offers a remote VS Code editor for developers to develop and build products with a secure browser at the edge, hastening development cycles.
