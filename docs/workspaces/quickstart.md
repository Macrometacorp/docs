The Workspaces homepage displays the different tools configured for your work and allows you to navigate between these tools. After setting up the appriopriate installer for your use-case, you can now start using [RBA](./remote-browser-accelerator/index.md) or [VDI](./remote-desktop-enviroment/index.md). 

Workspaces also offers a remote VS Code editor for developers to develop and build products with a secure browser at the edge, hastening development cycles. 


### Peripheral devices

Cloud Workspaces support various peripherals across RBA and VDI. For RBA, you can test and validate these connected devices before using it in your workspace. Refer to [Validating peripheral devices in RBA guide](./remote-browser-accelerator/rba-peripheral-validator.md) for more details. You can also visit the [VDI guide](./remote-desktop-enviroment/index.md) to learn more about the supported peripheral devices for remote desktops.
