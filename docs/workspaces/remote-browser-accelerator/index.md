title: Remote Browser Acceleration (RBA)
---

Remote Browser Acceleration (RBA) enhances the performance of specific web applications by deploying them directly at the network edge. This allows users to interact with web apps remotely as if they were running locally on their devices, ensuring optimal speed and responsiveness. By offloading processing tasks to a remote browser, RBA ensures faster page load times, improved responsiveness, and consistent performance, even on legacy or resource-constrained systems.

## Getting started

At the end of this guide, you will be able to:

- Download and install the RBA installer
- Get RBA started and launch your necessary work applications.
- Use the RBA control bar for a better experience

## Prerequisites
