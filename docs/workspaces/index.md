## Cloud Workspaces toolbox

At its core, Cloud Workspaces integrates the following advanced technologies:

- **[Remote Browser Acceleration (RBA)](./remote-browser-accelerator/index.md)**: RBA enhances the performance of specific web applications by deploying them directly at the network edge. It extends remote browser isolation by allowing users to interact with web apps as if running locally on their devices, ensuring optimal speed and responsiveness. By accelerating the delivery of these applications, RBA guarantees a better user experience and improved work efficiency. 
- **[Remote Desktop Environments (RDE)](./remote-desktop-enviroment/index.md)**: RDE provides full-featured Windows and Linux remote desktop environments accessible from any device with an internet connection. These desktops are hosted in the cloud and are powerful, enabling users to perform intensive workloads with less powerful machines. VDI ensures consistency and flexibility, enabling users to maintain productivity regardless of location.

These technologies work together to deliver a versatile and secure workspace solution on the edge, tailored to the diverse needs of modern businesses. It enables rapid deployment of web applications, secure and isolated browsing sessions, and full-featured virtual desktopsâ€” all within a unified environment designed to enhance productivity and maintain strong security.
