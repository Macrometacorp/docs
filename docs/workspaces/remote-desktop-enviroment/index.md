Cloud Workspaces extends its capabilities by offering Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI), providing users with remote access to Windows 10 and Linux Ubuntu desktop environments directly through their web browsers. The VDI has two types:

- **Persistent VDI:** With a persistent VDI, your desktop session persists even after exiting the browser, ensuring that every subsequent login resumes from your previous session, preserving work progress and improving productivity and efficiency. 
- **Non-persistent VDI:** Every new login to this type starts a fresh user session. This type works best for concise tasks. 

## Accessing your remote desktop environment

To begin, select the operating system you wish to use from the workspaces menu.

This action will open a new tab establishing a secure connection to the selected remote desktop environment. You will then have full access to a remote Windows or Linux desktop, enabling you to perform your tasks as if you were working on a local machine.

From this point, you can begin your work just as you would on a local machine. Launch applications, access files, use the terminal or browser, configure your settings - all within the secure confines of your browser tab.

While your virtual desktop is running on remote hardware, performance remains consistent regardless of your local device's capabilities. This means you can tackle resource-intensive tasks even from less powerful machines.

As you use the virtual desktop, keep in mind that any changes or files you create are saved within the virtual environment. Depending on your configuration, these changes may persist between sessions, allowing you to pick up right where you left off.

### Windows remote desktop menu
