title: Using the Linux desktop
---

With the remote Linux desktop, you can  access a full Linux environment from Cloud Workspaces. This guide walks you through the process of connecting to your remote Linux desktop after successfully [running the VDI installer](index.md#download-the-vdi-installer).

## Connecting to the remote Linux desktop
To start using the remote Linux desktop.

1. Navigate to the **Workspaces** home page.
2. Locate the **Linux Web Dev** option and click the **Connect** button next to it.

This action opens the remote Linux desktop environment in a new browser tab. Once the environment is loaded, you can launch applications, access files, use the terminal or browser, and configure your settings as needed.
