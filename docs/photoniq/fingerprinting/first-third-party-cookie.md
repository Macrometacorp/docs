title: First- and Third-Party Cookies
---

Web browsers employ first-party and third-party cookies to store information and help run programs on your system. These cookies serve different purposes and possess different privacy implications. 

## First-Party Cookies

First-party cookies are created by the host domain, i.e., the website the user visits. For example, when visiting example.com, the cookies stored by example.com are first-party cookies. This class of cookies helps improve user experience and is considered non-intrusive. Some examples of these cookies include:

- **User authentication cookies:** These cookies help store login and authentication details.
- **Language preference cookies :** Cookies in this class are offered by multi-lingual sites and help to store your preferred language so that subsequent visits to the same site display in your preferred language.
- **Personalization cookies:**  Personalization cookies store your preferred browsing settings and preferences to ensure a seamless browsing experience.
- **Session management cookies:** These cookies improve browsing sessions by keeping track of changes during a previous session as a user moves from page to page. 

Other first-party cookies include analytics, security, and e-commerce shopping cart cookies. 

### Using First-party Cookies

Information collected by first-party cookies are only shared with the host website. They also help improve the user experience when navigating a site by storing login details, personalizing website settings, and tracking user behavior for the site's own analytics.

### Data Privacy Concerns and Implications

Data privacy laws consider first-party cookies essential as they are 
generally considered less intrusive in terms of privacy, as their usage often occurs by the site the user has chosen to visit. However, they can still raise privacy concerns, especially when collecting sensitive information.

## Third-Party Cookies

Domains other than the host domain are responsible for third-party cookies. These cookies are usually embedded via scripts set within a webpage and used by ad networks or analytics companies with items embedded in the website.

### Using Third-party Cookies

These cookies are widely used for online advertising, cross-site tracking, re-targeting, and ad personalization.

### Data Privacy Concerns and Implications

These cookies are deemed non-essential by data privacy laws and have several concerns:

  - **Cross-Site Tracking**: Third-party cookies can track users' browsing activity across multiple sites, leading to privacy concerns. This tracking is often used for targeted advertising and can result in detailed user profiles.
  - **Data Sharing**: The information collected by third-party cookies can be shared with or sold to other organizations, further exacerbating privacy concerns.
  - **Regulatory Challenges**: Due to these privacy issues, third-party cookies face increasing scrutiny and regulatory challenges. Laws like the GDPR in Europe and CCPA in California impose strict rules on the implementation and use of third-party cookies and often require explicit consent from users.

## Browser Policies

The increasing awareness of user privacy and regulatory concerns about using cookies resulted in the following changes: 

- Browsers like Safari and Firefox have implemented strict policies to block third-party cookies by default.
- Google Chrome has also announced plans to phase out third-party cookies by the second half of 2024, subject to regulatory requirements. 

While these measures aim to enhance user privacy, they also present challenges for advertisers and businesses relying on third-party cookies for tracking and ad personalization.
