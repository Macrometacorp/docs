title: First- and Third-Party Cookies
---

First-party and third-party cookies are used in web browsing, but they serve different purposes and have different privacy implications. This page explains the key differences and issues associated with each.

## First-Party Cookies

- **Definition**: First-party cookies are created and stored by the website a user visits. For example, if you visit example.com, the cookies stored by example.com are first-party cookies.
- **Usage**: These cookies are typically used for remembering login details, personalizing website settings, and tracking user behavior for the site's own analytics.
- **Privacy Concerns**: First-party cookies are generally considered less intrusive in terms of privacy, because they are used by the site that the user has chosen to visit. However, they can still raise privacy concerns, especially when collecting sensitive information.

## Third-Party Cookies

- **Definition**: Third-party cookies are created by domains other than the one the user visits directly, hence the name "third-party." Scripts or tags are usually set within a webpage and can be used by ad networks or analytics companies with items embedded in the website.
- **Usage**: These cookies are widely used for online advertising, cross-site tracking, re-targeting, and ad personalization.
- **Privacy Concerns**:
  - **Cross-Site Tracking**: Third-party cookies can track users' browsing activity across multiple sites, leading to privacy concerns. This tracking is often used for targeted advertising and can result in detailed user profiles.
  - **Data Sharing**: The information collected by third-party cookies can be shared with or sold to other organizations, further exacerbating privacy concerns.
  - **Regulatory Challenges**: Due to these privacy issues, third-party cookies face increasing scrutiny and regulatory challenges. Laws like the GDPR in Europe and CCPA in California impose strict rules on how third-party cookies can be used and require explicit consent from users.

## Browser Policies

- Browsers like Safari and Firefox have implemented strict policies to block third-party cookies by default. Google Chrome has also announced plans to phase out third-party cookies.
- These measures aim to enhance user privacy, but they also present challenges for advertisers and businesses that rely on third-party cookies for tracking and ad personalization.
