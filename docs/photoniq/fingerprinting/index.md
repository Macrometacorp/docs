Fingerprint operates with a dual-component approach:

- Client-side agent in the user's browser
- Server-side code

This two-component approach ensures reliable identification across diverse devices and browsers, providing a secure, privacy-conscious alternative to conventional tracking and enabling businesses to convert anonymous traffic into valuable, actionable insights without compromising compliance or visitor privacy. 

Our Fingerprint service prioritizes visitor privacy, adhering to regional data regulations while integrating seamlessly with existing systems.
