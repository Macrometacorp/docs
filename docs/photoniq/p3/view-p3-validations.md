After you create a policy and PhotonIQ Performance Proxy (P3) gets a request for an optimized page, P3 validates the page by running visual and functional tests. You can view these validations in the PhotonIQ Performance Proxy dashboard.

## View Validations

Perform the following steps to view P3 validations:

1. Log in to your PhotonIQ Performance Proxy dashboard.
2. Click **Validations**.

    The Validations table provides the following fields:

    - **Origin** - The base URL that was validated.
    - **URL Pattern** - The specific URL that was validated.
    - **Last Updated** - When the optimization was last updated.
    - **Validation** - Types of validation. Click one to view it.
