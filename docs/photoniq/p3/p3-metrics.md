## Requests Metrics

- **Requests Count (1hr, 1d, 1m)**: The total number of requests processed by P3 over the past hour, day, and month, respectively.
- **Request Errors Count (1hr, 1d, 1m)**: The number of requests that resulted in errors during processing over the past hour, day, and month.
- **Requests Optimized Count (1hr, 1d, 1m)**: Counts the requests that were successfully optimized by P3 in the last hour, day, and month, showcasing the efficiency of optimizations.
- **Requests Unoptimized Count (1hr, 1d, 1m)**: The count of requests that were not optimized over the past hour, day, and month, providing insights into potential areas for improvement.

## Optimizer Metrics

- **Pages Optimized**: Total pages that have been successfully optimized, indicating the scope and impact of P3's optimization efforts.
- **Pages Failed to Optimize**: The number of pages that could not be optimized, highlighting challenges or limitations faced during the optimization process.
- **Average Optimization Time (seconds)**: The average time taken to optimize a page, measured in seconds. This metric helps in evaluating the efficiency of the optimization process.
- **Average Validation Time (seconds)**: Average time spent validating the optimizations applied to ensure they meet the desired standards and do not negatively impact the user experience.
- **Average Analyzer Time (seconds)**: Reflects the average time taken by the Offline Analyzer to assess and formulate optimization strategies for a webpage.
