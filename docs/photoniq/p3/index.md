## Architecture

P3 operates based on a comprehensive offline analysis of web pages and their associated resources. This allows for the dynamic updating and caching of content to achieve optimal performance.

The P3 system is built on three primary components:

- **Offline Analyzer**: Scheduled to run at regular intervals, this component scans customer web pages for performance issues. Using algorithms and expert insights from Macrometa Global Data Network (GDN), it generates optimization rules, which are then sent to the P3 proxy.

- **Proxy**: Functioning as an intermediary for customer website origins, the proxy focuses on enhancing page content and resource performance. It utilizes the rules set by the offline analyzer to optimize the loading and rendering sequence of resources, apply advanced image and content compression techniques, and manage caching.

- **Deployer**: Fully integrated into the Macrometa GDN global infrastructure, the deployer facilitates the deployment of P3 across different regions, making it adaptable to various customer requirements.
