---

PhotonIQ Performance Proxy (P3) is an AI-driven platform specifically crafted for enterprises focused on optimizing their website performance. P3 uses ML page validation and an AI-native foundation to reorganize and optimizes your CSS and JavaScript. This ensures accelerated load times, lower bounce rates, and a seamless user experience, which results in a higher conversion rate.

As a fully-managed service, P3 greatly reduces the need for ongoing technical oversight, thereby conserving your time and resources. P3 addresses technical challenges such as improving mobile and desktop performance parity, reducing high bounce rates, and streamlining the continuous site optimization process.

Enhancing core web vitals, P3 improves user engagement and search engine visibility, which is pivotal in driving organic traffic and elevating revenue opportunities. With P3, technical teams can confidently future-proof their websites, achieving enduring performance enhancements with streamlined effort.

## Benefits of P3

- **Improved User Experience**: Faster loading times and lower bounce rates contribute to an overall enhanced user experience, increasing customer retention and conversion rates.
- **Improved Performance**: Improve the performance of your website at scale without having to invest in updating thousands of lines of code, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **Better SEO Ranking**: Faster website performance helps improve SEO rankings, increasing the likelihood of more organic traffic.
- **Increased Revenue**: Improving SEO, page performance, and user experience leads to increased revenue.
- **Cost Savings**: Efficient resource utilization reduces the need for additional server scaling during high-traffic events, yielding cost savings. Save time because you’re fixing a significant problem (CSS & JS) with relatively little effort.
- **Reduced Maintenance Time**: P3 continues to adapt and eliminates the need for expert engineering.

## Architecture

P3 operates based on a comprehensive offline analysis of web pages and their associated resources. This allows for the dynamic updating and caching of content to achieve optimal performance.

The P3 system is built on three primary components:

- **Offline Analyzer**: Scheduled to run at regular intervals, this component scans customer web pages for performance issues. Using algorithms and expert insights from Macrometa Global Data Network (GDN), it generates optimization rules, which are then sent to the P3 proxy.

- **Proxy**: Functioning as an intermediary for customer website origins, the proxy focuses on enhancing page content and resource performance. It utilizes the rules set by the offline analyzer to optimize the loading and rendering sequence of resources, apply advanced image and content compression techniques, and manage caching.

- **Deployer**: Fully integrated into the Macrometa GDN global infrastructure, the deployer facilitates the deployment of P3 across different regions, making it adaptable to various customer requirements.
