Constant observation and monitoring of the P3 service helps you identify, fix, and improve optimizations. P3 offers numerous ways to monitor this service with:

- [P3 metrics](p3-metrics.md): This contains metrics and values that informs you of the performance of key P3 parameters.
- [Alerts](view-p3-alerts.md): To receive reports on any P3 issues affecting optimizations.
- [Audits](view-p3-audit-log.md): Review logs to observe applied optimizations and their process.
