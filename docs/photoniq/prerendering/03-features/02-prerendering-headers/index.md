Headers in Prerendering allow you to tailor the prerendering process to your specific requirements. You can exercise control over prerendering behavior with customizable passthrough, allowlist, and caching control headers. You can specify which pages should be prerendered based on unique attributes, allowing you to focus on a specific user base.
