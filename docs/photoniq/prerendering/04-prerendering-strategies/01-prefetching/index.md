Macrometa provides different options for you to configure prefetching jobs, and monitor the status and activity of prefetching:

- The web console
- REST API endpoints. To trigger prefetching for an origin, use the API endpoint to [trigger prefetching process](https://www.macrometa.com/docs/apiPrerendering#/paths/api-prerender-v1-origins-origin--prefetch-triggers/post).
