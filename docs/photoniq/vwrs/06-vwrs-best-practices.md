title: Best Practices for using VWRs
---

This page provides information on best practices for using Macrometa PhotonIQ Virtual Waiting Rooms (VWRs).

## Refresh Interval

When configuring refresh interval on mobile applications, consider its impact on mobile device battery life and data usage as frequent updates increase both consumption metrics.

## UI Responsiveness

Take advantage of PhotonIQ's asynchronous network calls to make your REST API calls when updating your waiting room. These low-latency calls ensures your application remains responsive with information displaying correctly, ensuring pleasant user experience.
