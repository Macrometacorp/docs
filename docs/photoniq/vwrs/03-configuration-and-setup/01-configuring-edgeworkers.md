title: Configure a VWRs EdgeWorker
---

# Overview

VWRs require [Akamai EdgeWorker Documentation](https://techdocs.akamai.com/edgeworkers/docs) to execute functions at the edge to help redirect and optimize web traffic for your websites. To get started using EdgeWorkers with VWRs, you need to import the `VirtualWaitingRoom` class from the photoniq-vwrs-client using Node Package Manager (NPM). This integrates the VWRs with the EdgeWorker. 

## Setting Up EdgeWorkers

### Prerequisites
To configure EdgeWorkers for use with VWRs, you need the following:

- An [Akamai EdgeWorker resource tier](https://techdocs.akamai.com/edgeworkers/docs/resource-tier-limitations): Because the VWRs EdgeWorker performs up to two sub-requests, this resource tier must allow at least two HTTP sub-requests on the `onClientRequest` event handler. 
- [Akamai Property Manager user-defined variables](https://techdocs.akamai.com/edgeworkers/docs/request-object#setvariable): This helps set the value of the Property Manager user-defined variable to control how Akamai controls network traffic. PhotonIQ uses about 350 characters out of the 1024 limit set by Akamai. 

### Step 1: Install the PhotonIQ VWRs Client

Before you can set up an EdgeWorker, you must install `@macrometa/photoniq-vwrs-client`.

1. To set the authentication token, open your terminal and execute the following command. This command configures npm to use the specified authentication token when interacting with the npm registry. Make sure you replace <YOUR_READ_KEY> with your actual read key:
   Now, you are ready to install the private package. Npm uses the previously set authentication token to authenticate and download the package. In your terminal, run the following command:

```bash
npm install @macrometa/photoniq-vwrs-client
```

2. After the package installation is complete, verify its presence. Check your projectâ€™s node_modules directory to ensure that `@macrometa/photoniq-vwrs-client` has been successfully installed.

:::note
If you encounter a _404 Not Found error_ when trying to install `@macrometa/photoniq-vwrs-client`, then check your .npmrc file to ensure that it has a valid registry set and the valid token is set. This file should contain the correct configuration for accessing npm packages.

### Step 2: Configuring Options
After installing the VWRs client, you need to configure some options. While some of these options are mandatory, others are optional.

#### Mandatory Configuration Options

The following configuration options must be set:

- **apiKey**: Use the [VWRs authorization key API](https://www.macrometa.com/docs/apiVwrs#/operations/createAPIKey) to create this key.
- **vwrsMetricHost**: The host for the VWRs metric service.
- **vwrsHost:**The host for the VWRs service.
- **digestKey**: The digest key verifies the integrity of the data stored in the cookie. Please use a 128-bit or 256-bit key. For example, you can generate a key using the command `openssl rand -hex 16`.
- **encryptionKey**: This key encrypts the waiting room data stored in the cookie. The key must be either 128 or 256 bits long. For example, you can generate a key using the command `openssl rand -hex 16`.

#### Optional Configuration Options

The following configuration options are optional:

- **isFailOpen**: Has a default value set to `true`, which forwards request to the origin server if an error occurs. However, with a `false` value, an occurrence of error displays an error message.
- **originAccessMode**: This option determines how long access is granted to the origin server (default: `ORIGIN_USAGE_TIME`):
  - **ORIGIN_USAGE_TIME**: The access time, defined for each domain (`max_origin_usage_time`), remains fixed. Once a user is granted access to the origin, they can only access it for the duration specified in the `max_origin_usage_time` field.
  - **ORIGIN_IDLE_TIME:** The access time, defined for each domain, increases by the number of seconds specified in the `max_origin_usage_time` field. Each time this domain is accessed, the access time is extended accordingly. This behaves similarly to an abandonment timeout, where the session is abandoned if the request has been idle for the `max_origin_usage_time` time.
- **statusConfigLimits**: This defines the waiting room information that is returned by the status call. Use the following three values to define what the status page returns:
  - **avgWaitingTime**: If set to `true`, then the average waiting time is returned by the status call. (default: `true`)
  - **qDepth**: If set to `true`, then the waiting room queue size is returned. (default: `true`)
  - **position**: If set to `true`, then the position of the request in the waiting room queue is returned. (default: `true`)

#### Request Configuration

A request configuration is an optional object that contains configuration parameters for the request handler. Options include:

- **waitingRoomPath**: The cloud origin (such as NetStorage) path to the waiting room HTML.
- **extraFingerprint**: Additional data to include in the fingerprint calculation.
- **debugMode**: This flag enables debug mode. In debug mode, the unencrypted cookie is stored in the `x-vwrs-debug` header and logged to the logger (default: `false`).
- **priority:** A positive whole number indicates the priority of the request when a priority queue is enabled for the specific waiting room. This priority number must be one of the priorities configured for the waiting room.


## EdgeWorker Example

An example of `main.js` in an EdgeWorker bundle:

```js
import { logger } from "log";
import VirtualWaitingRoom from "./library/virtualWaitingRoom.js";

const virtualWaitingRoomConfiguration = new VirtualWaitingRoom({
  apiKey: "YourAPIKey",
  digestKey: "YourVwrsDigestKey",
  encryptionKey: "YourVwrsEncryptionKey",
  vwrsMetricHost: "api-demo-vwr-metrics.paas.macrometa.io",
  vwrsHost: "api-demo-vwr.paas.macrometa.io",
  isFailOpen: "true",
  originAccessMode: "ORIGIN_USAGE_TIME",
  statusConfigLimits: {
    avgWaitingTime: true,
    qDepth: true,
    Position: true,
  },
});

export async function onClientRequest(request) {
  const reqOptions = {
    waitingRoomPath: "/1473985/doc.html",
    debugMode: true,
    extraFingerprint: [request.getVariable("PMUSER_TFDH")],
  };

  const result = await virtualWaitingRoomConfiguration.handleVwrsRequest(
    request,
    reqOptions
  );
  if (result.waitingRoom) {
    // Request sent to waiting room
  }
}

export async function onClientResponse(request, response) {
  const reqOptions = {
    debugMode: true,
    extraFingerprint: [request.getVariable("PMUSER_TFDH")],
  };

  const result = await virtualWaitingRoomConfiguration.handleVwrsResponse(
    request,
    response,
    reqOptions
  );
  if (result.waitingRoom) {
    // Request sent to waiting room
  }
}
```
