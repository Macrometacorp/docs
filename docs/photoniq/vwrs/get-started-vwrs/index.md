Macrometa PhotonIQ Virtual Waiting Rooms (VWRs) are essential tools for managing high traffic volumes on websites and applications (apps), ensuring server stability and enhancing user experiences during peak times. By implementing VWRs, you can prevent server overload and potential downtime, which is crucial for maintaining service availability and user satisfaction.

## App Integration Types

Different types of applications require distinct approaches to integrate with Virtual Waiting Rooms (VWRs). Depending on the application's platform and user interaction model, the integration process can vary significantly. The paragraphs below explain how both web and mobile applications can effectively use VWRs to manage traffic and enhance user experiences.

### Web Apps

Web apps, also called non-native apps or browser-based apps, typically web-based, use standard web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These applications run within web browsers and are the most common type of applications integrated with VWRs. The integration process for web apps is streamlined through web-based configurations, making it straightforward to implement effective traffic management solutions.

### Mobile Apps

Mobile apps, also called native apps or system-specific apps, are developed for specific platforms using platform-specific programming languages. Unlike web apps, mobile applications require direct API interactions to integrate with VWRs. In these scenarios, the application takes on a greater role in managing the user experience during high-traffic periods, including handling the display of waiting times and managing user expectations.
