title: VWRs Queue Types

This page describes the different types of queues supported by Virtual Waiting Rooms.

## FIFO

The system operates the FIFO (first in, first out) queue on a "first come, first served" basis. As new requests are added to the queue, they push older requests closer to the front. When the system removes a request from the front of the queue, all subsequent elements move up one position.

## Random

In the random queuing approach, requests are chosen from the queue indiscriminately, without preference or priority. Each request in the queue possesses an equal likelihood of being selected for processing. This method is beneficial when prioritizing requests based on their arrival time or other criteria. Introducing a random element can disperse the processing load.

## Lottery

The lottery queuing approach uses assigned priorities and is an advanced method of selecting requests from a queue. This method gives each request a priority or weight, representing its probability of being selected for processing. When removing a request, the system conducts a "lottery" to choose the winning request based on its assigned priority. This approach enables you to prioritize specific requests by giving them a higher priority, increasing their likelihood of being selected for processing.
