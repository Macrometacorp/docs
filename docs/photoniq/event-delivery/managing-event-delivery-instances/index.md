To optimize the performance of your event delivery service, PhotonIQ offers different ways to manage the behaviour of your EDS instances. These methods include:

- **Query, Set and Batch**: A layer that helps you batch and run a group of queries together, instead of running each individually, thus improving efficiency.
- **Connection**: An instance with numerous methods that helps you connect, retrieve and configure connection details, and disconnect your WebSocket/SSE connection.
- **Listeners and Error Handling**: These are grouped into global, query, result, and error listeners and helps handles events.
