title: Setting Up Event Stream in GDN
---

The Event Delivery service allows you to stream and filter events from Macrometa streams and also publish events to these streams. 
Some important concepts to know:
- **Publisher**: An application or service that continuously generates data for consumption by a subscriber. Collections in the Macrometa GDN act as publishers in the Event Delivery Service (EDS)
- **Subscriber**: Subscribes to events from the publisher. Subscribers can use SQL-queries to subscribe to specific events, thus reducing noise and focusing on the necessary data.
- **Stream**: A named channel for sending messages. The GDN backs every stream in the GDN with a distributed append-only log and can be local (at one edge location only) or global (across all edge locations in the [fabric](../../../geofabrics/)).
- **Event**: Every new data point/message generated by the publisher.

Let's set up our first stream in a GDN.

## Prerequisites
- A [Macrometa account](https://auth-play.macrometa.io/) with sufficient permissions to create connections. Contact a Macrometa partner to sign up or [sign up](https://www.macrometa.com/sign-up) on your own. With a Macrometa account set up, you can decide what kind of collection to stream your data into. 
The PhotonIQ GDN allows you to create:
    - [Document Collection](../../collections/documents/) - Accepts any document type.
    - [Key-Value Collection](../../collections/keyvalue/) - Accepts key-value pairs, can be set up to include blobs.

:::tip

Consult with Macrometa Partners to help decide the best type for your business use case.

:::
- An application to receive event delivery streams.
- Plan your filters. Filters are set up by adding queries to event subscriptions. 


## Set Up Your Stream in the GDN
1. (Optional) [Create a fabric](../../../geofabrics/create-geofabric.md) for your collection. A fabric allows you to decide exactly where your data lives. Skipping this step means the collection will reside in the system fabric. 
1. Create a collection to receive streaming data.

:::important

Make sure to enable streams when you [create a collection](https://www.macrometa.com/docs/collections/).

3. Navigate to [collection settings](https://www.macrometa.com/docs/collections/view-collection-settings) to view and access information about your collection.

Your collection settings provides useful information like:
- **Resource URL** - The endpoint sending data to your collection. All messages sent here are both stored and transmitted to the stream.
- **Stream Name** - Name of our data stream.
- **Fabric Name** - Name of our fabric. 
In the screenshot above, the fabric name is **_system**.
