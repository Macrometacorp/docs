title: Get Started with FaaS
---

## Objective

In this getting started guide, we:

- Create a template function locally
- Build the template function locally
- Test the template function locally
- Deploy the locally developed function to a remote environment

PhotonIQ FaaS allows you to create and interact with your functions in two ways:

- API requests
- FaaS CLI

### Step 1 - Create a New Function
After installing the CLI, the first step is to create a function. You can do this with the following command:
```bash
./faas new testFunction
```

If the command executes successfully, you will receive the following message:
```bash
Template function has been created in path: functions/testFunction
Configuration can be modified in the file: functions/testFunction/photoniq.toml
```

> [!NOTE]  
>Although the default function template is created in `Rust`, PhotonIQ functions also support `Javascript`. The template function is in the functions folder at the specified path. 

### Step 2 - Write Function Code
Creating a function automatically creates a function template. Let's write the function code for our new function:

1. Open the newly created function in your preferred IDE.  Locate this new function in the `functions` folder. The folder containing your function code and its configuration bears the same name as your new function(`testFunction`).

Your IDE opens up to the following code:
```rust
use anyhow::Result;
use photoniq_faas_sdk::{
    binding::{
        http::{HttpRequest, HttpResponse, HttpResponseBuilder},
        log,
    },
    function_handler,
};
use std::env;

#[function_handler]
fn handler(_req: HttpRequest) -> Result<HttpResponse> {
    let message = env::var("MESSAGE").unwrap_or_else(|_| String::from("Missing message"));

    let response = format!(
        "PhotonIQ FaaS function is working!

Env Var MESSAGE = {}",
        message
    )
    .to_string();

    // Log messages with the following methods: error!, warn!, info!, debug!, trace!
    log::error!("[{}:{}] Log an [ERROR] message", file!(), line!());

    Ok(HttpResponseBuilder::ok().body(response.into()).build())
}
```

The initial part of this code with `use` commands is boilerplate code.
2. Write your custom code in the handler function.

```rust
fn handler(_req: HttpRequest) -> Result<HttpResponse> {
    <USER CODE IS WRITTEN HERE>
}
```

An HTTP request to the URL defined in the `photoniq.toml` triggers this function. 
A default `photoniq.toml` settings file looks like this:

```bash
name = "testFunction"
version = "0.0.1"
description = "Description for function testFunction"
lang = "rust"
execute_url_suffix = "optional_url_suffix_to_execute_function"

[cors_settings]
allowed_methods = ["GET","POST"]
allowed_hosts = ["macrometa.com"]
allow_http = true

[log_settings]
enabled = true
level = "INFO"

[env_vars]
MESSAGE = "Hello ðŸ‘‹! This message comes from an environment variable"
```

> [!Tip]
> To understand the different parts making up a function, read about the [structure of a FaaS function](faas-structure.md).

### Step 3 - Test Function Locally
1. To test the function that we have created, we first need to build it using the build command.
```bash
./faas build testFunction
```
If the function is successfully built, you will see the following message:
```
Function 'testFunction' has been successfully built!
```

2. Start the local test server by running the faas run command.
```bash
./faas run testFunction
```

3. Open a new terminal window and enter the `faas execute` command. This runs the template code in our new `testFunction`.
```bash
./faas execute testFunction
```

The message below shows our code executed successfully:
```bash
PhotonIQ FaaS function is working!

Env Var MESSAGE = Hello ðŸ‘‹! This message comes from an environment variable
```

### Step 4 - Deploy Function and Execute Remotely

### Prerequisites
- Contact Macrometa personnel(this should be a link to the personnel) to get credentials to access the PhotonIQ remote server. You will need:
    - API_KEY
    - URL

#### Deploying Functions to Remote PhotonIQ Server

Now that our function is working locally, let's deploy it to the remote PhotonIQ server:
```bash
./faas remote deploy testFunction
```
Once the function is deployed, you can execute the remote function using the `remote execute` command:
```bash
./faas remote execute testFunction
```

>[!NOTE]
> Running any remote command to access a PhotonIQ server requires authentication by entering your API_KEY and API_URL.
