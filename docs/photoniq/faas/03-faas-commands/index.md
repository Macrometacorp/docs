title: FaaS CLI Commands
---

PhotonIQ offers its interactive FaaS CLI to enable you to run and manage functions from your local machine. This CLI is available for [installation on Linux, MacOS, and Windows](../02-quickstart/01-faas-cli-install.md) and grants you access to remote and local CLI commands. 

## CLI Commands

The FaaS CLI offers two sets of commands:
- `local`: Local commands work with an instance of a local server running on your machine, allowing you to create, test, and debug functions before deploying to the PhotonIQ platform.
- `remote`: These commands serve to interact with the PhotonIQ platform.
