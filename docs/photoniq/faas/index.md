title: Function as a Service (FaaS)
---

PhotonIQ FaaS (Function as a Service) is an edge-computing service that allows you to run code  without managing the complex infrastructure. Deployed functions are executed from the closest point of presence to customers.

PhotonIQ FaaS supports Rust and Python, empowering developers with flexibility and eliminating vendor lock-in. This platform is tailored for applications requiring high performance, rapid scalability, and low latency, making it an ideal solution for modern, cloud-native development.

PhotonIQ FaaS revolutionizes application development by abstracting the complexities of infrastructure management, allowing you to deploy fast and scalable serverless functions globally. Whether you are processing data, integrating services, or building an entire application, PhotonIQ FaaS provides the tools and performance you need to succeed.

## How PhotonIQ FaaS Works

PhotonIQ FaaS allows you to deploy lightweight, high-performance functions in the form of [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/) modules. When an HTTP request is made to a specific endpoint, the corresponding worker (function) is triggered to process the request. This event-driven model ensures that resources are utilized only when necessary, and the stateless nature of functions ensures they can independently handle multiple requests in parallel. The platform automatically manages the deployment, scaling, and execution of these functions, allowing developers to focus solely on their code.

## Benefits of PhotonIQ FaaS

- **High Performance**: Leverages the near-native execution speed of WebAssembly, enhancing application responsiveness and efficiency.
- **Global Scalability**: With built-in geo-replication, functions are replicated across multiple regions to reduce latency and improve the reliability of your applications.
- **Developer Flexibility**: Supports multiple languages, providing a broad spectrum of tools and libraries to suit your development needs.
- **Cost Efficiency**: Only charges for the actual compute time and resources used, which optimizes spending and reduces waste.
- **Simplified Management**: Automates many operational tasks such as scaling, deployments, and maintenance, freeing up your time and resources.
- **Enhanced Security**: Executes functions in a sandboxed environment, ensuring isolation and protecting against unauthorized access and attacks.

## Features of PhotonIQ FaaS

- **Multiple Language Support**: Offers compatibility with Rust and JavaScript.
- **Automatic Scaling**: Dynamically adjusts the number of function instances based on request volume to handle any load efficiently.
- **Geo-Replication**: Automatically distributes function instances across global locations to minimize response times and maximize availability.
- **Integrated Developer Tools**: Provides tools such as a CLI for deployment and management, and a dashboard for monitoring function metrics and logs.
- **Comprehensive Logging and Metrics**: Captures detailed logs and performance metrics to help diagnose issues and optimize function behavior.
- **Advanced Function Capabilities**: Supports HTTP requests, interactions with various Macrometa GDN stores, environment variables, and more.
- **Secure Execution**: Ensures secure communications and robust security controls for function execution and data handling.
