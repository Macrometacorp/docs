This demo app implements PhotonIQ Fingerprint to prevent coupon misuse. It identifies unauthenticated or anonymous site visitors, even when they switch tabs, use incognito mode, or clear browsing data, ensuring coupons can only be claimed once per visitor. With this service, businesses can protect their special offers, maintaining profitability and earning customer trust.

## Demo Site

To start exploring this demo, simply navigate to the [Coupon Fraud Prevention](https://coupon-fraud-prevention.macrometa.app/) page. Once there, you can try to redeem the coupons available. You'll see how the system handles unique user detection to prevent coupon abuse.

You can open another tab and repeat the process. Notice how the system recognizes attempts to redeem the same coupon multiple times, demonstrating its effectiveness in preventing coupon misuse.
