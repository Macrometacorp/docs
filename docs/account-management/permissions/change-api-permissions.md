1. Log in to your [Macrometa account](https://auth-play.macrometa.io/).
2. Click **Account**.
3. Click the **API Keys** tab.
4. Click the API key in the list that you want to change permissions for.
5. On the Permissions tab, select the option for the permissions you want to assign.

   Refer to [Permissions](index.md) for information about each permission level.
