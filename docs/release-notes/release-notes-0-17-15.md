This document describes what has changed in Macrometa release 0.17.15. To check what version of GDN you are using, use the [RestVersionHandler](https://macrometa.com/docs/api#/operations/RestVersionHandler) command in the API.

## New Features

The following new features are included in this release.

### KV Blob Storage

Key-value (KV) store collections now allow you to store blobs (arbitrary binary data, such as images).

When you create a new key-value store, you can select the **Blob storage** checkbox. This marks the collection as a blob-based KV collection. These collections can only be used to store blobs. Once created, this setting cannot be changed.

- Maximum blob file size is 1 MB. This can be changed, but can never exceed 2 MB.
- You can add blob records using the Macrometa API. Adding records in the Macrometa web console is not supported.

This feature is available upon request. Contact support@macrometa.com to enable it on your account.

The [Create a Key-Value Store](../account-management/plans/) has been updated as a result of this change.

### Stream Worker Store Batch Support

In previous versions of Macrometa, stream worker stores could only persist one document per call. The 17.15 release supports batches, persisting documents until the value of one of the two new parameters is reached.

The new parameters are:

- `batch.size`
- `batch.flush.time.ms`

[Stream Worker Tables](../cep/table/) was updated as a result of this change.

### Retrieve API Keys

As of this release, an API key created using `POST /_api/key` can now be retrieved using `GET /_api/key/{keyid}`.

The call and response now look similar to the following:

```bash
curl -X 'GET'   'https://api-your-macrometa.eng.macrometa.io/_api/key/root_api_keyid777777'   -H 'accept: application/json'   -H 'Authorization: bearer <JWT>' | jq
