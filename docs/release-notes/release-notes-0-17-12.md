### Streams Process Messages with _delete Fields in Database Extension (CEP-440)

In previous versions of Macrometa, the `database` extension for streams skipped messages with a `_delete` field, because they mark deleted collection documents.

This release adds the following functionality:

- Introduce parameter `skip.event.with._delete` in `database` extension.
- The default value for `skip.event.with._delete` is `true`.
- Allow processing of all messages when the `skip.event.with._delete` is `false`.
