### Update Name and Email on User Accounts

You can now update names and email addresses on user accounts. If you are a `root` user or have admin permissions, then you can update names and email addresses on user accounts that you administer.

### API Updates

This release includes the following API changes.

| Issue #  | Description  |
|---|---|
| API-178  | Add region URL to the API response.  |
| DB-1500  | Add new database limits: `maxWorkersCpuSecondsPerMinute` (default value is 20 seconds/minute of CPU time), `maxWorkersLogsLengthKBPerMinute` (default value is 10 KB/minute of logs length).  |
| DB-1588  | Removed one fabric parameter from Users API, because having two parameters was confusing. Now consistent with other APIs.  |
| DB-1592  | Make `GET /_api/collection/{collection-name}/figures` API public. This allows users to view metadata such as how many indexes and views a collection has, total collection size, and how many documents a collection has. |
| DB-1606  | Allow `*` in certain User APIs for collections and fabrics. APIs are: GET, DELETE, and PUT for `/_fabric/{fabric}/_api/user/{user}/database/{geofabric}` and GET, DELETE, and PUT for `/_fabric/{fabric}/_api/user/{user}/database/{geofabric}/collection/{collection}`. |

### New CLI Release

GDN CLI (`gdnsl`) version 0.0.45 is now available! If you use the Macrometa CLI, be sure to update as soon as possible.

For more information, refer to [Command Line Interface](../cli).

### Unique Index Option Change

Due to defect DB-1242, the unique index option has been temporarily turned off for new global collections. This option will be available when the longer-term solution is ready.

### Collection Truncation Messages

When you truncate a collection with streams enabled, you will now only see one message rather than multiple delete messages.

## Defect Fixes

The following defects were fixed in this release.

:::note
This last release cycle, our CEO challenged our engineers to try to "break" Macrometa as part of our internal quality and reliability improvement efforts. The results are below and will contribute to a more stable and reliable Global Data Network going forward.
