### Update Name and Email on User Accounts

You can now update names and email addresses on user accounts. If you are a `root` user or have admin permissions, then you can update names and email addresses on user accounts that you administer.

### API Updates

This release includes the following API changes.

| Issue #  | Description  |
|---|---|
| API-178  | Add region URL to the API response.  |
| DB-1500  | Add new database limits: `maxWorkersCpuSecondsPerMinute` (default value is 20 seconds/minute of CPU time), `maxWorkersLogsLengthKBPerMinute` (default value is 10 KB/minute of logs length).  |
| DB-1588  | Removed one fabric parameter from Users API, because having two parameters was confusing. Now consistent with other APIs.  |
| DB-1592  | Make `GET /_api/collection/{collection-name}/figures` API public. This allows users to view metadata such as how many indexes and views a collection has, total collection size, and how many documents a collection has. |
| DB-1606  | Allow `*` in certain User APIs for collections and fabrics. APIs are: GET, DELETE, and PUT for `/_fabric/{fabric}/_api/user/{user}/database/{geofabric}` and GET, DELETE, and PUT for `/_fabric/{fabric}/_api/user/{user}/database/{geofabric}/collection/{collection}`. |

### Miscellaneous Changes

DB-1539 Disable unique index option for newly created indices for global collections
DB-1661 Disable SEARCH feature for FREE plan tenants
DB-1486 Views isolation between tenants
DB-1523 Make expiration of JWT for service user configurable

## Defect Fixes

The following defects were fixed in this release.

:::note
This last release cycle, our CEO challenged our engineers to try to "break" Macrometa as part of our internal quality and reliability improvement efforts. As a result, we found a lot of (occasionally weird) bugs, and then fixed them. The results are below and will contribute to a more stable and reliable Global Data Network going forward.
