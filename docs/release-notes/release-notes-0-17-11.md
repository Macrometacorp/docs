This document describes what has changed in Macrometa release 0.17.11. To check what version of GDN you are using, use the [RestVersionHandler](https://www.macrometa.com/docs/api#/operations/RestVersionHandler) API command.

## New Features

The following new features are included in this release.

### Search and Stream Workers are in GA

[Search](../search/index.md) and [Stream Workers](../cep/index.md), previously only available in closed beta, are now generally available for everyone to use.

### Invite User

You can now invite users to your Macrometa account by sending them email.

[Invite Users](../account-management/users/invite-users.md) was added as a result of this feature.

### Manage Attributes in Console

You can now manage attributes for users and API keys in the Macrometa console.

[Attributes](../account-management/attributes/index.md) was added as a result of this feature.

### Akamai EdgeWorker Support - Preview

This release adds support for Akamai edge workers as functions in GDN. For more information, refer to [Akamai in Macrometa](../akamai/index.md).

### SQL Support - Beta

Macrometa now supports SQL queries. Support will be expanded in future releases.

[SQL in Macrometa](../queryworkers/sql/index.md) was added as a result of this feature.

### Redis Support - Beta

Macrometa now offers Redis support.

[Redis Mode Collections](../collections/redis-mode/index.md) and [Redis in Macrometa](../queryworkers/redis/index.md) were added as a result of this feature.

### Kafka Support - Beta

This release adds support for some Kafka clients in the GDN. For a list of supported clients, refer to [Kafka on GDN](../streams/kafka_on_gdn/index.md).

## Feature Updates

The following features updates are included in this release.

### Migration to Play - Breaking Change

The previous generic global URL `api-gdn.paas.macrometa.io` is no longer valid.

Customers with Macrometa Play tier accounts _can_ use `api-play.paas.macrometa.io` as a substitute, but we do not recommend it.

Instead, we recommend that you use an account-specific global or regional URL, which you can find in the API Reference in the Macrometa web console or on your GeoFabrics page. Any endpoint listed on the GeoFabric will accept API calls if you prepend `api-` to it.

For more information, refer to [Unique Global URL vs. Generic](../api-docs/index.md#unique-global-url-vs-generic).

### Stream Worker Prefixes

You can now prepend a stream worker name to the aggregation tables that it creates. For example, if the stream worker name is `SampleAggregationApp` and the aggregation is `TradeAggregation,` then it will create tables like `SampleAggregationApp-TradeAggregation_SECONDS`. Previously, it was just `TradeAggregation_SECONDS`.

### Auth Improvements

- We redesigned Macrometa authorization to make our service more efficient and stable.
- The account signup and login screens have been updated and improved.

### API Updates

This release includes the following API changes.

| Issue #  | Description  |
|---|---|
| APIDOC-51  | Added stream worker parameters `maxLogsLengthKBPerMinutePerWorker` and `maxCpuSecondsPerMinutePerWorker`. |
| APIDOC-54  | In API reference docs, corrected a typo in insertDocument description.  |
| DB-1692  | The fabric creation endpoint in the API now allows up to 40 characters for fabric names, just like in the web console.  |
| DB-1704  | Clarified in the API documentation for [Import API](https://www.macrometa.com/docs/api#/operations/ImportCollectionData) that the `_key` must be a string.  |

#### Import and Export Changes (DB-1660)

- You can now export in Vpack format.
- Added batching support for importing and exporting.

#### User Changes (DB-1783)

- The `user` parameter is deprecated and will not be used while creating the new user. For backward compatibility, it will not generate any errors.
- Provided a new optional parameter `displayName` to set the display name of the user. Whitespaces are allowed.

Here is a sample for the updated request body:

```bash
curl -X 'POST' \ 'https://api-qa6.eng.macrometa.io/_api/user' \ 
-H 'accept: application/json' \ 
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \ 
-H 'Authorization: bearer <token> \
-d { 
    "active": true, 
    "email": "test1@bar1.com", 
    "passwd": "P@55w0rd", 
    "displayName":"John Doe" 
    }'
```

## Known Issues

The following known issues were introduced in this release.

### Stream Workers and Query Workers are Limited to Owners

**Problem:** Currently the stream workers and query workers are scoped by tenant, fabric, and owner where owner is the user account that created the worker. The result of this is stream workers and query workers created by one user cannot be seen by another user belonging to same tenant and fabric.

**Workaround:** If you encounter this issue, then reduce the scope to tenant and fabric for the workers so that all users with permission on a GeoFabric can see the stream workers and query users regardless of which user created them.

### Local Stream is Not Accessible after Upgrade from 17.10 to 17.11

**Problem:** Sometimes local streams are not accessible in the Macrometa console.

**Workaround:** If you encounter this error, then run the [Publish Message](https://www.macrometa.com/docs/api#/operations/PublishStreamMessage) API endpoint for particular stream to get rid of the issue.

`POST               /_fabric/_system/_api/streams/{stream}/publish`

For more information about running API commands, refer to [APIs](../api-docs/index.md).
