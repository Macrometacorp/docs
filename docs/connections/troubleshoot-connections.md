This page contains suggestions to help you figure out why your connection or ETL workflow is not working. If your connection is still not functioning properly after you have eliminated these issues as possibilities, then submit a [Macrometa Support request](https://support.macrometa.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?) or email support@macrometa.com.

## Allowlist Macrometa

If you need an IP address to add Macrometa to an allowlist, then submit a [Macrometa Support request](https://support.macrometa.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?) or email support@macrometa.com.

## Source Table Definition Changes

If the source table changed, such as a new column was added, then Macrometa will stop importing new records. Manually reload the collection to fix this issue.

## Check Connector Type Docs

Some of the connectors have special prerequisites or settings, which are documented in the specific [Connector Type](./connector-types/) documentation. Refer to the page that matches the connector you are having difficulty with.
