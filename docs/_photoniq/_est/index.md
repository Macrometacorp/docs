---

PhotonIQ Server-Side Tagging is an innovative solution that moves resource-intensive third-party scripts (used for advertising, analytics, tracking, etc.) from the end-userâ€™s browser to the edge, dramatically enhancing both web performance and data privacy.

## Why does this matter?

Improved performance doesn't just enhance the user experience; it directly impacts the bottom line. The ripple effects of enhanced site performance, from reduced bounce rates to increased session duration, result in higher conversion rates and greater revenue. Especially for large e-commerce enterprises, even fractional improvements with PhotonIQ Server-Side Tagging can yield substantial revenue gains.
