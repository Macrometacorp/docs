Semantic search is a technique that allows searches based on the intent and contextual meaning of search phrases, rather than just keyword matching. It understands the relationships between words and concepts to provide more relevant results.

For example, a keyword search for "flights to Paris" would simply match documents containing those words. A semantic search would understand the intent is to find available flights to Paris and return pages for booking flights, rather than any page mentioning Paris and flights.

## Benefits of Semantic Search

- More accurate results based on meaning and intent, not just keywords
- Handles typos, synonyms, related concepts
- Understands context to disambiguate words with multiple meanings
- Answers questions directly rather than just listing documents

## Examples of Semantic Search Use Cases

- E-commerce sites can understand product searches like "red sneakers for running" and return the most relevant results, even if the query doesn't match product titles exactly.
- Voice assistants can understand spoken questions like "what's the weather tomorrow in Paris?" and provide a direct answer rather than just web search results.
- Searching a corporate knowledge base for "refund policy" could return the exact document describing the refund policy rather than every document mentioning refunds.

## Semantic Search Queries

Semantic search view features are integrated into C8QL as a set of C8QL functions.
