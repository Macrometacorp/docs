In the context of HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) indexing for nearest neighbor search, `NLinks` generally refers to the number of connections or "links" a given node (data point) has to its neighboring nodes within the graph.

In the HNSW algorithm, each node in the graph has a set of connections to other nodes. These connections are built during the indexing process and are used during search to navigate through the graph. A higher number of links can make the search faster but will require more memory during indexing, because more connections need to be stored. Conversely, a smaller number of links can slow down the search but will save memory.

The optimal number of links can depend on various factors, such as the dimensionality of your data and the size of your dataset. It's often a parameter that needs to be tuned based on your specific requirements and constraints.
