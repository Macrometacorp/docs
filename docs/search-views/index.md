# Macrometa Search Views

Search views in Macrometa are structured ways to query your global data network. They improve the speed and accuracy of data retrieval. Macrometa offers two types of search views: fulltext search and semantic search.

## Fulltext Search

Fulltext search is a method that searches for exact matches of terms or phrases in your query. It uses an index, which lists each word in the document and its location. Fulltext search is effective when the requirement is to find documents containing specific words or phrases.

## Semantic Search - Beta

Semantic search is a different approach that understands the intent behind a search query and the meanings of words. Macrometa semantic search currently provides similarity search, with more functionality planned in future releases.
