title: STARTS_WITH()
---

Match the value of an attribute that starts with a prefix. If the attribute is tokenized or is an array, then a document only needs a single token or element to return in the query.

### Syntax

`STARTS_WITH(path, prefix)`

| Key   | Type                    | Description                                     |
|-------|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| path  | attribute path expression | The path to the attribute in the document.    |
| prefix | string                  | A string to search for at the start of text.   |


The alphabetical order of characters is not taken into account by search. Range queries in `SEARCH` operations against views do not follow the language rules as defined by a locale analyzer.

### Examples

This example returns a `"lorem ipsum"` document using a prefix and an identity analyzer:

```js
FOR doc IN viewName
  SEARCH STARTS_WITH(doc.text, "lorem ip")
  RETURN doc
```

If a view indexes the `text` attribute and processes it with an English text analyzer, then this query returns `"lorem ipsum"`and `"lorem", "ipsum"`:

```js
FOR doc IN viewName
  SEARCH ANALYZER(STARTS_WITH(doc.text, "ips"), "text_en")
  RETURN doc.text
```

The query does not return `"IPS (in-plane switching)"` because the analyzer has stemming enabled.

Assume you have an array of stemmed tokens which apply to `"IPS (in-plane switching)"`:

```json
[
  [
    "ip",
    "in",
    "plane",
    "switch"
  ]
]
```

In this example, the `s` is removed from `ips`, which causes the prefix `ips` not to match the indexed token `ip`. You can apply the stemming rules to the document attribute in addition to the prefix, increasing the likelihood of a match:

```js
FOR doc IN viewName
  SEARCH ANALYZER(STARTS_WITH(doc.text, TOKENS("ips", "text_en")[0]), "text_en")
  RETURN doc.text
```
