The BM25 scoring function utilizes the [Best Matching 25 (BM25) algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okapi_BM25) to sort documents based on their relevance.

### Syntax

`BM25(doc, k, b) â†’ score`

`doc` (document): Specified by `FOR ... IN viewName`
`k` (number, _optional_): Adjusts the text term frequency scaling. Defaults to `1.2`. 
`b` (number, _optional_): Determines the scaling by the total text length. Defaults to `0.75`.

### Examples

The following example returns documents sorted by relevance using the BM25 scoring function with default settings:

```c8ql
FOR doc IN viewName
  SEARCH ...
  SORT BM25(doc) DESC
  RETURN doc
```

This example demonstrates sorting by relevance with a double-weighted term frequency and full text length normalization:

```c8ql
FOR doc IN viewName
  SEARCH ...
  SORT BM25(doc, 2.4, 1) DESC
  RETURN doc
```
