This page discusses how graphs are represented and managed in relational databases compared to Macrometa GDN, focusing on concepts such as vertex collections, traversal, edge index, and edge attributes.

## Representing Graphs in Relational Databases

In a relational database, you'd typically store the vertices of a graph in one table and the edges in another. Each edge would have a foreign key for its starting vertex and one for its ending vertex.

## Bipartite Graphs and m:n Relations

For a bipartite graph, you can use two tables A and B for the two vertex sets, and the edge table would simply contain one foreign key for A and one for B. This data model is also known as a "link table" or "junction table" and serves as the standard solution for m:n relations.

## GDN: A Flexible Document Store

GDN is a document store that provides efficient joins in its query language. You can use a vertex collection and an edge collection to achieve the desired complexity guarantees. You can also store arbitrary labeling information for both vertices and edges along with their corresponding JSON documents.

## Vertex Collections and Traversal

Vertex collections are similar to data tables with objects to connect. While simple graph queries with a fixed number of hops via the relation table might be possible in SQL with several nested joins, GDN can handle an arbitrary number of these hops over edge collections - this is called traversal.

## Edge Index for Efficient Lookup

GDN uses a special edge index to achieve O(k) neighbor lookup complexity. This index is a hash table that tolerates repeated keys and keeps elements with equal keys together in a linked list. The joins help combine the edge documents with their corresponding vertices.

## Edge Attributes and Directionality

Edges in a single edge collection can point to multiple vertex collections. It's common to attach attributes to edges, like a label naming the interconnection. Edges have a direction, with their relations `_from` and `_to` pointing from one document to another document stored in vertex collections.

Querying Edge Directions
In queries, you can specify the directions in which edge relations can be followed, such as:

- OUTBOUND: `_from` → `_to`
- INBOUND: `_from` ← `_to`
- ANY: `_from` ↔ `_to`
