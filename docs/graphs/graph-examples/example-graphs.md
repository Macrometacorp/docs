Macrometa has several example graphs that you can create and use to explore the GDN graph functionality. When you create an example graph, Macrometa creates the named graph as well as collections loaded with vertex and edge data.

:::note
With the default "Search Depth" of 2 of the graph viewer, you might not see all edges of some graphs unless you load the full graph.

## Create Example Graph

To create an example graph:

1. In the Macrometa web console, navigate to **Graphs**.
2. Click **New Graph**, and then click **Examples**.
3. Click **Create** next to the graph that you want to create. The graphs are described below.

## The Knows Graph

The Knows Graph shows a group of people that know each other.

![Persons relation Example Graph](/img/graphs/knows_graph.png)

The Knows Graph consists of one vertex collection, `persons`, connected via one edge collection, `knows`.
It contains five persons: _Alice_, _Bob_, _Charlie_, _Dave_ and _Eve_.
The person records have the following directed relations:

- _Alice_ knows _Bob_
- _Bob_ knows _Charlie_
- _Bob_ knows _Dave_
- _Eve_ knows _Alice_
- _Eve_ knows _Bob_

## The Traversal Graph

This graph was designed to demonstrate filters in traversals. It has some labels to filter on in it.

![Traversal Graph](/img/graphs/traversal_graph.png)

The example stores its vertices in the `circles` document collection and the edges in the  `edges` edge collection.

The circles records have unique numeric labels. The edges have two boolean attributes (_theFalse_ always being false, _theTruth_ always being true) and a label sorting _B_ - _D_ to the left side, _G_ - _K_ to the right side. Left and right side split into paths - at _B_ and _G_ which are each direct neighbors of the root-node _A_. Starting from _A_ the graph has a depth of 3 on all its paths.

## The MPS Graph

This graph is named after the [multiple path search (MPS)](multiple-path-search-example) use case. It was created to demonstrate a use case of the shortest path algorithm. Even though the algorithm can only determine one shortest path, it is possible to return multiple shortest paths with two separate queries.

The MPS graph consists of vertices in the `mps_verts` collection and edges in the `mps_edges` collection. It is a simple traversal graph with start node _A_ and end node _C_.

## The World Graph

The world country graph structures its nodes: world → continent → country → capital. In some cases, edge directions aren't forward (therefore it will be displayed disjunct in the graph viewer).

This graph can be used to demonstrate raw traversal operations. The vertices are stored in `worldVertices`, the edges are stored in `worldEdges`.

## The Social Graph

This graph shows a set of persons and their relations. Female and male person records are stored as vertices in two vertex collections - `female` and `male`. The edges are their connections in the `relation` edge collection.

## The City Graph

This graph shows a set of european cities, and their fictional traveling distances as connections. The cities as vertices in two vertex collections - `germanCity` and `frenchCity`. The edges are their interconnections in several edge collections: `frenchHighway`, `germanHighway`, and `internationalHighway`.
