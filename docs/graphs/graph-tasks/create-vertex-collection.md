A vertex collection stores the vertices or nodes that are connected by edges in a graph.

To create a vertex collection, follow the instructions in [Create a Document Collection](../../collections/documents/create-document-store).

Once created, you can add documents using one of the methods in [Add Documents to Collection](../../collections/documents/add-document) to add vertex records to the collection.
