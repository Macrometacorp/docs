title: Scoring Functions
---

Scoring functions return a ranking value for the documents found by a [search query](../queries/index.md). A higher number indicates a better match.

The first argument to any scoring function is always the document specified by a `FOR` operation.

To sort documents with the most relevant ones shown first, use descending order `DESC`.

You can calculate custom scores based on a scoring function using document attributes and numeric functions (e.g. `TFIDF(doc) * LOG(doc.value)`):

```sql
FOR movie IN imdbView
  SEARCH PHRASE(movie.title, "Star Wars", "text_en")
  SORT BM25(movie) * LOG(movie.runtime + 1) DESC
  RETURN movie
```

You can sort by a mix of scores and attributes from multiple search views and collections:

```sql
FOR a IN viewA
  FOR c IN coll
    FOR b IN viewB
      SORT TFIDF(b), c.name, BM25(a)
      ...
```

## BM25()

Sorts documents using the [Best Matching 25 (BM25) algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okapi_BM25).

### Syntax

`BM25(doc, k, b) → score`

- `doc` (document): Must be specified by `FOR ... IN viewName`
- `k` (number, _optional_): Calibrates the text term frequency scaling. The default is `1.2`. A _k_ value of `0` corresponds to a binary model (no term frequency), and a large value corresponds to using raw term frequency
- `b` (number, _optional_): Determines the scaling by the total text length. The default is `0.75`. At the extreme values of the coefficient _b_, BM25 turns into the ranking functions known as:
  - BM11 for _b_ = `1` (fully scaling the term weight by the total text length).
  - BM15 for _b_ = `0` (no length normalization).

### Example

This query returns a numeric score that represents the computed ranking value.

Sorting by relevance with BM25 at default settings:

```sql
FOR doc IN viewName
  SEARCH ...
  SORT BM25(doc) DESC
  RETURN doc
```

Sorting by relevance, with double-weighted term frequency and with full text length normalization:

```sql
FOR doc IN viewName
  SEARCH ...
  SORT BM25(doc, 2.4, 1) DESC
  RETURN doc
```

## BOOST()

Boost modifies the importance of a specific search expression within a query. Default boost value is `1.0`.

### Syntax

`BOOST(expr, boost)`

- `expr` (expression): A valid search expression.
- `boost` (number): Numberic boost value.

### Example

This example searches for documents that contain keywords `foo` or `bar`, and sorts the results based on their relevance using the BM25 scoring function.

```sql
FOR doc IN viewName
  SEARCH ANALYZER(BOOST(doc.text == "foo", 2.5) OR doc.text == "bar", "text_en")
  LET score = BM25(doc)
  SORT score DESC
  RETURN { text: doc.text, score }
```

Assuming a view with the following documents indexed and processed by the
`text_en` analyzer:

```sql
{ "text": "foo bar" }
{ "text": "foo" }
{ "text": "bar" }
{ "text": "foo baz" }
{ "text": "baz" }
```

The returned result:

```sqlon
[
  {
    "text": "foo bar",
    "score": 2.787301540374756
  },
  {
    "text": "foo baz",
    "score": 1.6895781755447388
  },
  {
    "text": "foo",
    "score": 1.525835633277893
  },
  {
    "text": "bar",
    "score": 0.9913395643234253
  }
]
```

## TFIDF()

Sorts documents using the [term frequency–inverse document frequency algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TF-IDF) (TF-IDF).

### Syntax

`TFIDF(doc, normalize) → score`

- `doc` (document): Must be specified by `FOR ... IN viewName`.
- `normalize` (bool): Specifies whether scores should be normalized. The default is `false`. Optional.
- returns `score` (number): Computed ranking value.

### Example

This example searches for documents and sorts by relevance using the TF-IDF score:

```sql
FOR doc IN viewName
  SEARCH ...
  SORT TFIDF(doc) DESC
  RETURN doc
```

This example searches for documents and sorts by relevance using a normalized TF-IDF score:

```sql
FOR doc IN viewName
  SEARCH ...
  SORT TFIDF(doc, true) DESC
  RETURN doc
```

This example searches for documents and sorts by the `text` attribute in ascending order, then sorts by the TFIDF score in descending order where the attribute values are equivalent:

```sql
FOR doc IN viewName
  SEARCH ...
  SORT doc.text, TFIDF(doc) DESC
  RETURN doc
```
