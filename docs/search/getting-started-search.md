In this getting started guide, you will add search functionality to the Address Book app that you build in the [Macrometa Quickstart](https://www.macrometa.com/docs/quickstart).

## Create a Search View

Refer to the [Search Views](/search/views/index.md) section for an explanation of how search views function.

1. [Log in to your Macrometa account](https://auth-play.macrometa.io/).
1. Click **Search Views**.
1. Click **New View**.
1. In the **Name** field, enter `addresses_view`.
1. Click the **plus** under Mapping Definition.
1. Select the `addresses` collection from the COLLECTION list. 
1. Enter `lastName` in `field` and select **text_en** in the ANALYZER list. 
1. Perform the previous three steps again for `firstName` and `email`.
1. Click **Create**.

Macrometa distributes this view index to every location in the global fabrics. If you're curious about the locations, click **Dashboard** to see the default [GeoFabric](geofabrics/index.md) locations.

Our view is now accessible worldwide, and your three address collection key values are indexed and ready to query.

## Query the View



1. On the side menu, click **Query Workers**.
1. The code block below is a search query that will allow you to pass in a query parameter to search you index. Copy and paste it in the code editor on line 1.

  ```sql
    FOR contact IN addresses_view
        SEARCH ANALYZER(
                BOOST(STARTS_WITH(contact.firstName, @searchTerm), 3) OR
                BOOST(STARTS_WITH(contact.lastName, @searchTerm), 2) OR 
                BOOST(STARTS_WITH(contact.email, @searchTerm), 1),
                "text_en"
            )
        SORT BM25(contact) DESC
        RETURN UNSET(contact, ["_id", "_rev"])
  ```

1. Add the word `nemo` to the searchTerm value to the right of the query editor window.
1. Click **Run Query**. You will see your results show up below the Run Query button.
1. (Optional) Click **Query Info** in the Query Result to see what the query did and how long each step took. Pretty cool if you're into performance metrics.

## Save the Query as an API Endpoint



Macrometa allows you to save a query as a [Query Worker](../queryworkers/index.md).

1. Click **Save Query**.
1. Name the query **getContactBySearchTerm** and then click **Save**. This saves the query so you can use it again.
1. Click **Run Query**.
1. Click **API Endpoint**.

Macrometa displays a cURL command that you can use to access this endpoint from anywhere in the world in under 50ms.

This query requires a value to be passed with each request, so you must enter one in the bind parameters or else the query will fail with an error.

You have created your first view and made it a RESTful endpoint with a query worker. [We made a front-end for you to take your new backend for a spin](https://github.com/Macrometacorp/tutorial-addressbook-streams).
