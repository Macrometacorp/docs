Macrometa GDN Search is a full-text search engine that supports key values, documents, and graphs as data models. Compared to a [full-text index](../collections/indexing/fulltext-indexes.md), Macrometa Search is more configurable and customizable, combining Boolean and generalized ranking retrieval techniques to refine your search results. All Boolean-approved results are ranked by relevance to the respective query using the Vector Space Model in conjunction with BM25 or TF-IDF weighting schemes.

## Features

GDN Search provides the following capabilities:

- Complex searches with Boolean operators
- Relevance-based matching
- Phrase and prefix matching
- Custom ranking and relevance tuning
- Configurable analyzers and tokenization
- Retrieval of both documents and projections of documents
- Combinable search queries with multiple supported data models & access patterns
- Geo-replicated search indexes for instant results

## Views and Analyzers

We provide _search views_ and _analyzers_ that boost the efficiency of your search queries:

- A [search view](views/) is a virtual collection that provides fast full-text searching over multiple linked collections.
- An [analyzer](analyzers/) parses input values and transforms them into sets of sub-values for the following use cases:

  - Tokenization (splitting text into words and normalizing them).
  - Language-specific word stemming.
  - Case conversion.
  - Removal of diacritical (accent) marks.

## Queries

GDN Search features are integrated into C8QL as a SEARCH operation and a set of C8QL functions. Some use cases include:

- Perform federated full-text searches over product descriptions in a web shop with product documents stored in collections.
- Retrieve information in a research database and rank it by relevance based on term frequency (TF-IDF) using case and accent insensitive stemmed phrases with irrelevant terms filtered out.
- Query a data set of movies for titles with words in a particular order and optional wild cards. Sort the results by best matching (BM25) but favor movies with longer duration.
