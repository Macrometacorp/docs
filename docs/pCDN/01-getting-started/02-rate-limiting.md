title: Rate Limiting
---

As an API gateway, pCDN acts as the central host to all incoming and outgoing traffic from client requests. However, this traffic may also contain unwanted requests generated by web crawlers from malicious cyberware, as seen in a DDoS attack, which causes service downtime. 

pCDN uses the limit-count plugin to limit the number of API requests sent to the upstream addresses within a given time.
