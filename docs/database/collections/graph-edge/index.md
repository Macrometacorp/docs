title: Graph Edge Collection
---

An edge collection is a specialized type of collection that stores the relationships between documents in other collections. The relationships can then be used in a graph. In graphs, these relationships are represented as directed, connecting two vertices.

Edge collections have a unique structure that includes two special attributes: `_from` and `_to`.

- The `_from` attribute represents the starting vertex of an edge, and it stores the vertex's unique identifier (usually in the format `collection_name/document_key`).
- The `_to` attribute represents the ending vertex of an edge and also stores the vertex's unique identifier.

Apart from the `_from` and `_to` attributes, edge collections can store additional attributes to describe properties or characteristics of the relationships, such as weight, type, or any other relevant metadata.
