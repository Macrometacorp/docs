## The Stack

The Macrometa docs are powered by [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a static site generator that helps developers ship beautiful, accessible docs. In addition to Docusaurus, we use [Stoplight Elements](https://stoplight.io/open-source/elements) for documenting our REST API and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling.

## Building

This section describes how you can get the Macrometa docs up and running on your machine.
### Prerequisites

- [Node](https://nodejs.dev/) ‚Äì Using a version manager like [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating) or [Volta](https://volta.sh/) is recommended.
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) ‚Äì Using the installation instructions [here](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install) or install with [Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/yarn#default).

### Installation

1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Macrometacorp/docs.git && cd docs
```

2. Install dependencies


```bash
yarn install
```

3. Run the docs in developer mode. This mode updates the build whenever you save a change, but it doesn't always make broken links obvious. Docs will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

```bash
yarn start
```

4. Before you push a PR, run the production build command. This will create a build and provide an extensive list of any broken links or any other issues that need to be addressed. Make any necessary fixes, then run this command again. Repeat until you do not see any errors in your build.

 ```bash
 yarn run build
 ```
 
 5. Display the production build. This serves the build you made in the previous step to `http://localhost:3000`. Unlike the developer mode, this build will not automatically update when you make a change.
 
 ```bash
 yarn run serve
 ```
 
### Troubleshooting

If you get a bunch of errors when you do a local build, first try updating your dependencies by running `yarn` in the top level of the `docs` directory. You must do this every time dependencies change.

You might also need to update yarn. If you do, follow the instructions displayed in the terminal.
